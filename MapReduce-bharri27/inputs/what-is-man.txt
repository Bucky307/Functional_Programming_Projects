WHAT IS MAN

I

A MAN THE MACHINE B PERSONAL MERIT

THE OLD MAN AND THE YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN CONVERSING THE OLD MAN HAD
ASSERTED THAT THE HUMAN BEING IS MERELY A MACHINE AND NOTHING MORE
THE YOUNG MAN OBJECTED AND ASKED HIM TO GO INTO PARTICULARS AND
FURNISH HIS REASONS FOR HIS POSITION

OLD MAN WHAT ARE THE MATERIALS OF WHICH A STEAMENGINE IS MADE

YOUNG MAN IRON STEEL BRASS WHITEMETAL AND SO ON

OM WHERE ARE THESE FOUND

YM IN THE ROCKS

OM IN A PURE STATE

YM NOIN ORES

OM ARE THE METALS SUDDENLY DEPOSITED IN THE ORES

YM NOIT IS THE PATIENT WORK OF COUNTLESS AGES

OM YOU COULD MAKE THE ENGINE OUT OF THE ROCKS THEMSELVES

YM YES A BRITTLE ONE AND NOT VALUABLE

OM YOU WOULD NOT REQUIRE MUCH OF SUCH AN ENGINE AS THAT

YM NOSUBSTANTIALLY NOTHING

OM TO MAKE A FINE AND CAPABLE ENGINE HOW WOULD YOU PROCEED

YM DRIVE TUNNELS AND SHAFTS INTO THE HILLS BLAST OUT THE IRON ORE
CRUSH IT SMELT IT REDUCE IT TO PIGIRON PUT SOME OF IT THROUGH THE
BESSEMER PROCESS AND MAKE STEEL OF IT MINE AND TREAT AND COMBINE
SEVERAL METALS OF WHICH BRASS IS MADE

OM THEN

YM OUT OF THE PERFECTED RESULT BUILD THE FINE ENGINE

OM YOU WOULD REQUIRE MUCH OF THIS ONE

YM OH INDEED YES

OM IT COULD DRIVE LATHES DRILLS PLANERS PUNCHES POLISHERS IN A
WORD ALL THE CUNNING MACHINES OF A GREAT FACTORY

YM IT COULD

OM WHAT COULD THE STONE ENGINE DO

YM DRIVE A SEWINGMACHINE POSSIBLYNOTHING MORE PERHAPS

OM MEN WOULD ADMIRE THE OTHER ENGINE AND RAPTUROUSLY PRAISE IT

YM YES

OM BUT NOT THE STONE ONE

YM NO

OM THE MERITS OF THE METAL MACHINE WOULD BE FAR ABOVE THOSE OF THE
STONE ONE

YM OF COURSE

OM PERSONAL MERITS

YM PERSONAL MERITS HOW DO YOU MEAN

OM IT WOULD BE PERSONALLY ENTITLED TO THE CREDIT OF ITS OWN
PERFORMANCE

YM THE ENGINE CERTAINLY NOT

OM WHY NOT

YM BECAUSE ITS PERFORMANCE IS NOT PERSONAL IT IS THE RESULT OF THE
LAW OF CONSTRUCTION IT IS NOT A MERIT THAT IT DOES THE THINGS WHICH
IT IS SET TO DOIT CANT HELP DOING THEM

OM AND IT IS NOT A PERSONAL DEMERIT IN THE STONE MACHINE THAT IT DOES
SO LITTLE

YM CERTAINLY NOT IT DOES NO MORE AND NO LESS THAN THE LAW OF ITS
MAKE PERMITS AND COMPELS IT TO DO THERE IS NOTHING PERSONAL ABOUT
IT IT CANNOT CHOOSE IN THIS PROCESS OF WORKING UP TO THE MATTER IS
IT YOUR IDEA TO WORK UP TO THE PROPOSITION THAT MAN AND A MACHINE ARE
ABOUT THE SAME THING AND THAT THERE IS NO PERSONAL MERIT IN THE
PERFORMANCE OF EITHER

OM YESBUT DO NOT BE OFFENDED I AM MEANING NO OFFENSE WHAT MAKES
THE GRAND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STONE ENGINE AND THE STEEL ONE SHALL
WE CALL IT TRAINING EDUCATION SHALL WE CALL THE STONE ENGINE A SAVAGE
AND THE STEEL ONE A CIVILIZED MAN THE ORIGINAL ROCK CONTAINED THE
STUFF OF WHICH THE STEEL ONE WAS BUILTBUT ALONG WITH A LOT OF SULPHUR
AND STONE AND OTHER OBSTRUCTING INBORN HEREDITIES BROUGHT DOWN FROM
THE OLD GEOLOGIC AGESPREJUDICES LET US CALL THEM PREJUDICES WHICH
NOTHING WITHIN THE ROCK ITSELF HAD EITHER POWER TO REMOVE OR ANY
DESIRE TO REMOVE WILL YOU TAKE NOTE OF THAT PHRASE

YM YES I HAVE WRITTEN IT DOWN PREJUDICES WHICH NOTHING WITHIN THE
ROCK ITSELF HAD EITHER POWER TO REMOVE OR ANY DESIRE TO REMOVE GO ON

OM PREJUDICES MUST BE REMOVED BY OUTSIDE INFLUENCES OR NOT AT ALL
PUT THAT DOWN

YM VERY WELL MUST BE REMOVED BY OUTSIDE INFLUENCES OR NOT AT ALL
GO ON

OM THE IRONS PREJUDICE AGAINST RIDDING ITSELF OF THE CUMBERING ROCK
TO MAKE IT MORE EXACT THE IRONS ABSOLUTE INDIFFERENCE AS TO WHETHER
THE ROCK BE REMOVED OR NOT THEN COMES THE OUTSIDE INFLUENCE AND
GRINDS THE ROCK TO POWDER AND SETS THE ORE FREE THE IRON IN THE ORE
IS STILL CAPTIVE AN OUTSIDE INFLUENCE SMELTS IT FREE OF THE CLOGGING
ORE THE IRON IS EMANCIPATED IRON NOW BUT INDIFFERENT TO FURTHER
PROGRESS AN OUTSIDE INFLUENCE BEGUILES IT INTO THE BESSEMER FURNACE
AND REFINES IT INTO STEEL OF THE FIRST QUALITY IT IS EDUCATED NOWITS
TRAINING IS COMPLETE AND IT HAS REACHED ITS LIMIT BY NO POSSIBLE
PROCESS CAN IT BE EDUCATED INTO GOLD WILL YOU SET THAT DOWN

YM YES EVERYTHING HAS ITS LIMITIRON ORE CANNOT BE EDUCATED INTO
GOLD

OM THERE ARE GOLD MEN AND TIN MEN AND COPPER MEN AND LEADEN MEN
AND STEEL MEN AND SO ONAND EACH HAS THE LIMITATIONS OF HIS NATURE
HIS HEREDITIES HIS TRAINING AND HIS ENVIRONMENT YOU CAN BUILD
ENGINES OUT OF EACH OF THESE METALS AND THEY WILL ALL PERFORM BUT YOU
MUST NOT REQUIRE THE WEAK ONES TO DO EQUAL WORK WITH THE STRONG ONES
IN EACH CASE TO GET THE BEST RESULTS YOU MUST FREE THE METAL FROM ITS
OBSTRUCTING PREJUDICIAL ONES BY EDUCATIONSMELTING REFINING AND SO
FORTH

YM YOU HAVE ARRIVED AT MAN NOW

OM YES MAN THE MACHINEMAN THE IMPERSONAL ENGINE WHATSOEVER A MAN
IS IS DUE TO HIS MAKE AND TO THE INFLUENCES BROUGHT TO BEAR UPON
IT BY HIS HEREDITIES HIS HABITAT HIS ASSOCIATIONS HE IS MOVED
DIRECTED COMMANDED BY EXTERIOR INFLUENCESSOLELY HE
ORIGINATES NOTHING NOT EVEN A THOUGHT

YM OH COME WHERE DID I GET MY OPINION THAT THIS WHICH YOU ARE
TALKING IS ALL FOOLISHNESS

OM IT IS A QUITE NATURAL OPINIONINDEED AN INEVITABLE OPINIONBUT
YOU DID NOT CREATE THE MATERIALS OUT OF WHICH IT IS FORMED THEY ARE
ODDS AND ENDS OF THOUGHTS IMPRESSIONS FEELINGS GATHERED
UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM A THOUSAND BOOKS A THOUSAND CONVERSATIONS AND FROM
STREAMS OF THOUGHT AND FEELING WHICH HAVE FLOWED DOWN INTO YOUR HEART
AND BRAIN OUT OF THE HEARTS AND BRAINS OF CENTURIES OF ANCESTORS
PERSONALLY YOU DID NOT CREATE EVEN THE SMALLEST MICROSCOPIC FRAGMENT
OF THE MATERIALS OUT OF WHICH YOUR OPINION IS MADE AND PERSONALLY YOU
CANNOT CLAIM EVEN THE SLENDER MERIT OF PUTTING THE BORROWED MATERIALS
TOGETHER THAT WAS DONE AUTOMATICALLYBY YOUR MENTAL MACHINERY IN
STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THAT MACHINERYS CONSTRUCTION AND
YOU NOT ONLY DID NOT MAKE THAT MACHINERY YOURSELF BUT YOU HAVE NOT
EVEN ANY COMMAND OVER IT

YM THIS IS TOO MUCH YOU THINK I COULD HAVE FORMED NO OPINION BUT
THAT ONE

OM SPONTANEOUSLY NO AND YOU DID NOT FORM THAT ONE YOUR MACHINERY
DID IT FOR YOUAUTOMATICALLY AND INSTANTLY WITHOUT REFLECTION OR THE
NEED OF IT

YM SUPPOSE I HAD REFLECTED HOW THEN

OM SUPPOSE YOU TRY

YM AFTER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR I HAVE REFLECTED

OM YOU MEAN YOU HAVE TRIED TO CHANGE YOUR OPINIONAS AN EXPERIMENT

YM YES

OM WITH SUCCESS

YM NO IT REMAINS THE SAME IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CHANGE IT

OM I AM SORRY BUT YOU SEE YOURSELF THAT YOUR MIND IS MERELY A
MACHINE NOTHING MORE YOU HAVE NO COMMAND OVER IT IT HAS NO COMMAND
OVER ITSELFIT IS WORKED SOLELY FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT IS THE LAW OF
ITS MAKE IT IS THE LAW OF ALL MACHINES

YM CANT I EVER CHANGE ONE OF THESE AUTOMATIC OPINIONS

OM NO YOU CANT YOURSELF BUT EXTERIOR INFLUENCES CAN DO IT

YM AND EXTERIOR ONES ONLY

OM YESEXTERIOR ONES ONLY

YM THAT POSITION IS UNTENABLEI MAY SAY LUDICROUSLY UNTENABLE

OM WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO

YM I DONT MERELY THINK IT I KNOW IT SUPPOSE I RESOLVE TO ENTER
UPON A COURSE OF THOUGHT AND STUDY AND READING WITH THE DELIBERATE
PURPOSE OF CHANGING THAT OPINION AND SUPPOSE I SUCCEED THAT IS NOT
THE WORK OF AN EXTERIOR IMPULSE THE WHOLE OF IT IS MINE AND PERSONAL
FOR I ORIGINATED THE PROJECT

OM NOT A SHRED OF IT IT GREW OUT OF THIS TALK WITH ME BUT FOR
THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED TO YOU NO MAN EVER ORIGINATES
ANYTHING ALL HIS THOUGHTS ALL HIS IMPULSES COME FROM THE OUTSIDE

YM ITS AN EXASPERATING SUBJECT THE FIRST MAN HAD ORIGINAL
THOUGHTS ANYWAY THERE WAS NOBODY TO DRAW FROM

OM IT IS A MISTAKE ADAMS THOUGHTS CAME TO HIM FROM THE OUTSIDE
YOU HAVE A FEAR OF DEATH YOU DID NOT INVENT THATYOU GOT IT FROM
OUTSIDE FROM TALKING AND TEACHING ADAM HAD NO FEAR OF DEATHNONE IN
THE WORLD

YM YES HE HAD

OM WHEN HE WAS CREATED

YM NO

OM WHEN THEN

YM WHEN HE WAS THREATENED WITH IT

OM THEN IT CAME FROM OUTSIDE ADAM IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH LET US NOT
TRY TO MAKE A GOD OF HIM NONE BUT GODS HAVE EVER HAD A THOUGHT WHICH
DID NOT COME FROM THE OUTSIDE ADAM PROBABLY HAD A GOOD HEAD BUT IT
WAS OF NO SORT OF USE TO HIM UNTIL IT WAS FILLED UP FROM THE OUTSIDE
HE WAS NOT ABLE TO INVENT THE TRIFLINGEST LITTLE THING WITH IT HE HAD
NOT A SHADOW OF A NOTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD AND EVILHE HAD
TO GET THE IDEA FROM THE OUTSIDE NEITHER HE NOR EVE WAS ABLE TO
ORIGINATE THE IDEA THAT IT WAS IMMODEST TO GO NAKED THE KNOWLEDGE CAME
IN WITH THE APPLE FROM THE OUTSIDE A MANS BRAIN IS SO CONSTRUCTED
THAT IT CAN ORIGINATE NOTHING WHATSOEVER IT CAN ONLY USE MATERIAL
OBTAINED OUTSIDE IT IS MERELY A MACHINE AND IT WORKS AUTOMATICALLY
NOT BY WILLPOWER IT HAS NO COMMAND OVER ITSELF ITS OWNER HAS NO
COMMAND OVER IT

YM WELL NEVER MIND ADAM BUT CERTAINLY SHAKESPEARES CREATIONS

OM NO YOU MEAN SHAKESPEARES IMITATIONS SHAKESPEARE CREATED
NOTHING HE CORRECTLY OBSERVED AND HE MARVELOUSLY PAINTED HE EXACTLY
PORTRAYED PEOPLE WHOM GOD HAD CREATED BUT HE CREATED NONE HIMSELF
LET US SPARE HIM THE SLANDER OF CHARGING HIM WITH TRYING SHAKESPEARE
COULD NOT CREATE HE WAS A MACHINE AND MACHINES DO NOT CREATE

YM WHERE WAS HIS EXCELLENCE THEN

OM IN THIS HE WAS NOT A SEWINGMACHINE LIKE YOU AND ME HE WAS A
GOBELIN LOOM THE THREADS AND THE COLORS CAME INTO HIM FROM THE
OUTSIDE OUTSIDE INFLUENCES SUGGESTIONS EXPERIENCES READING
SEEING PLAYS PLAYING PLAYS BORROWING IDEAS AND SO ON FRAMED THE
PATTERNS IN HIS MIND AND STARTED UP HIS COMPLEX AND ADMIRABLE
MACHINERY AND IT AUTOMATICALLY TURNED OUT THAT PICTURED AND GORGEOUS
FABRIC WHICH STILL COMPELS THE ASTONISHMENT OF THE WORLD IF
SHAKESPEARE HAD BEEN BORN AND BRED ON A BARREN AND UNVISITED ROCK IN
THE OCEAN HIS MIGHTY INTELLECT WOULD HAVE HAD NO OUTSIDE MATERIAL TO
WORK WITH AND COULD HAVE INVENTED NONE AND NO OUTSIDE INFLUENCES
TEACHINGS MOLDINGS PERSUASIONS INSPIRATIONS OF A VALUABLE SORT AND
COULD HAVE INVENTED NONE AND SO SHAKESPEARE WOULD HAVE PRODUCED
NOTHING IN TURKEY HE WOULD HAVE PRODUCED SOMETHINGSOMETHING UP TO THE
HIGHEST LIMIT OF TURKISH INFLUENCES ASSOCIATIONS AND TRAINING IN
FRANCE HE WOULD HAVE PRODUCED SOMETHING BETTERSOMETHING UP TO THE
HIGHEST LIMIT OF THE FRENCH INFLUENCES AND TRAINING IN ENGLAND HE ROSE
TO THE HIGHEST LIMIT ATTAINABLE THROUGH THE OUTSIDE HELPS AFFORDED BY
THAT LANDS IDEALS INFLUENCES AND TRAINING YOU AND I ARE BUT
SEWINGMACHINES WE MUST TURN OUT WHAT WE CAN WE MUST DO OUR ENDEAVOR
AND CARE NOTHING AT ALL WHEN THE UNTHINKING REPROACH US FOR NOT TURNING
OUT GOBELINS

YM AND SO WE ARE MERE MACHINES AND MACHINES MAY NOT BOAST NOR FEEL
PROUD OF THEIR PERFORMANCE NOR CLAIM PERSONAL MERIT FOR IT NOR
APPLAUSE AND PRAISE IT IS AN INFAMOUS DOCTRINE

OM IT ISNT A DOCTRINE IT IS MERELY A FACT

YM I SUPPOSE THEN THERE IS NO MORE MERIT IN BEING BRAVE THAN IN
BEING A COWARD

OM PERSONAL MERIT NO A BRAVE MAN DOES NOT CREATE HIS BRAVERY
HE IS ENTITLED TO NO PERSONAL CREDIT FOR POSSESSING IT IT IS BORN TO
HIM A BABY BORN WITH A BILLION DOLLARSWHERE IS THE PERSONAL MERIT IN
THAT A BABY BORN WITH NOTHINGWHERE IS THE PERSONAL DEMERIT IN THAT
THE ONE IS FAWNED UPON ADMIRED WORSHIPED BY SYCOPHANTS THE OTHER IS
NEGLECTED AND DESPISEDWHERE IS THE SENSE IN IT

YM SOMETIMES A TIMID MAN SETS HIMSELF THE TASK OF CONQUERING HIS
COWARDICE AND BECOMING BRAVEAND SUCCEEDS WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT

OM THAT IT SHOWS THE VALUE OF TRAINING IN RIGHT DIRECTIONS OVER
TRAINING IN WRONG ONES INESTIMABLY VALUABLE IS TRAINING INFLUENCE
EDUCATION IN RIGHT DIRECTIONSTRAINING ONES SELFAPPROBATION TO
ELEVATE ITS IDEALS

YM BUT AS TO MERITTHE PERSONAL MERIT OF THE VICTORIOUS COWARDS
PROJECT AND ACHIEVEMENT

OM THERE ISNT ANY IN THE WORLDS VIEW HE IS A WORTHIER MAN THAN HE
WAS BEFORE BUT HE DIDNT ACHIEVE THE CHANGETHE MERIT OF IT IS NOT
HIS

YM WHOSE THEN

OM HIS MAKE AND THE INFLUENCES WHICH WROUGHT UPON IT FROM THE
OUTSIDE

YM HIS MAKE

OM TO START WITH HE WAS NOT UTTERLY AND COMPLETELY A COWARD OR
THE INFLUENCES WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING TO WORK UPON HE WAS NOT AFRAID
OF A COW THOUGH PERHAPS OF A BULL NOT AFRAID OF A WOMAN BUT AFRAID
OF A MAN THERE WAS SOMETHING TO BUILD UPON THERE WAS A SEED NO
SEED NO PLANT DID HE MAKE THAT SEED HIMSELF OR WAS IT BORN IN HIM
IT WAS NO MERIT OF HIS THAT THE SEED WAS THERE

YM WELL ANYWAY THE IDEA OF CULTIVATING IT THE RESOLUTION TO
CULTIVATE IT WAS MERITORIOUS AND HE ORIGINATED THAT

OM HE DID NOTHING OF THE KIND IT CAME WHENCE ALL IMPULSES GOOD OR
BAD COMEFROM OUTSIDE IF THAT TIMID MAN HAD LIVED ALL HIS LIFE IN A
COMMUNITY OF HUMAN RABBITS HAD NEVER READ OF BRAVE DEEDS HAD NEVER
HEARD SPEAK OF THEM HAD NEVER HEARD ANY ONE PRAISE THEM NOR EXPRESS
ENVY OF THE HEROES THAT HAD DONE THEM HE WOULD HAVE HAD NO MORE IDEA
OF BRAVERY THAN ADAM HAD OF MODESTY AND IT COULD NEVER BY ANY
POSSIBILITY HAVE OCCURRED TO HIM TO RESOLVE TO BECOME BRAVE HE
COULD NOT ORIGINATE THE IDEAIT HAD TO COME TO HIM FROM THE
OUTSIDE AND SO WHEN HE HEARD BRAVERY EXTOLLED AND COWARDICE
DERIDED IT WOKE HIM UP HE WAS ASHAMED PERHAPS HIS SWEETHEART TURNED
UP HER NOSE AND SAID I AM TOLD THAT YOU ARE A COWARD IT WAS NOT
HE THAT TURNED OVER THE NEW LEAFSHE DID IT FOR HIM HE MUST NOT
STRUT AROUND IN THE MERIT OF IT IT IS NOT HIS

YM BUT ANYWAY HE REARED THE PLANT AFTER SHE WATERED THE SEED

OM NO OUTSIDE INFLUENCES REARED IT AT THE COMMANDAND
TREMBLINGHE MARCHED OUT INTO THE FIELDWITH OTHER SOLDIERS AND IN THE
DAYTIME NOT ALONE AND IN THE DARK HE HAD THE INFLUENCE OF EXAMPLE
HE DREW COURAGE FROM HIS COMRADES COURAGE HE WAS AFRAID AND WANTED
TO RUN BUT HE DID NOT DARE HE WAS AFRAID TO RUN WITH ALL THOSE
SOLDIERS LOOKING ON HE WAS PROGRESSING YOU SEETHE MORAL FEAR OF
SHAME HAD RISEN SUPERIOR TO THE PHYSICAL FEAR OF HARM BY THE END OF
THE CAMPAIGN EXPERIENCE WILL HAVE TAUGHT HIM THAT NOT ALL WHO GO INTO
BATTLE GET HURTAN OUTSIDE INFLUENCE WHICH WILL BE HELPFUL TO HIM AND
HE WILL ALSO HAVE LEARNED HOW SWEET IT IS TO BE PRAISED FOR COURAGE AND
BE HUZZAD AT WITH TEARCHOKED VOICES AS THE WARWORN REGIMENT MARCHES
PAST THE WORSHIPING MULTITUDE WITH FLAGS FLYING AND THE DRUMS BEATING
AFTER THAT HE WILL BE AS SECURELY BRAVE AS ANY VETERAN IN THE ARMYAND
THERE WILL NOT BE A SHADE NOR SUGGESTION OF PERSONAL MERIT IN IT
ANYWHERE IT WILL ALL HAVE COME FROM THE OUTSIDE THE VICTORIA CROSS
BREEDS MORE HEROES THAN

YM HANG IT WHERE IS THE SENSE IN HIS BECOMING BRAVE IF HE IS TO GET
NO CREDIT FOR IT

OM YOUR QUESTION WILL ANSWER ITSELF PRESENTLY IT INVOLVES AN
IMPORTANT DETAIL OF MANS MAKE WHICH WE HAVE NOT YET TOUCHED UPON

YM WHAT DETAIL IS THAT

OM THE IMPULSE WHICH MOVES A PERSON TO DO THINGSTHE ONLY IMPULSE
THAT EVER MOVES A PERSON TO DO A THING

YM THE ONLY ONE IS THERE BUT ONE

OM THAT IS ALL THERE IS ONLY ONE

YM WELL CERTAINLY THAT IS A STRANGE ENOUGH DOCTRINE WHAT IS THE
SOLE IMPULSE THAT EVER MOVES A PERSON TO DO A THING

OM THE IMPULSE TO CONTENT HIS OWN SPIRITTHE NECESSITY OF
CONTENTING HIS OWN SPIRIT AND WINNING ITS APPROVAL

YM OH COME THAT WONT DO

OM WHY WONT IT

YM BECAUSE IT PUTS HIM IN THE ATTITUDE OF ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR HIS
OWN COMFORT AND ADVANTAGE WHEREAS AN UNSELFISH MAN OFTEN DOES A THING
SOLELY FOR ANOTHER PERSONS GOOD WHEN IT IS A POSITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO
HIMSELF

OM IT IS A MISTAKE THE ACT MUST DO HIM GOOD FIRST OTHERWISE HE
WILL NOT DO IT HE MAY THINK HE IS DOING IT SOLELY FOR THE OTHER
PERSONS SAKE BUT IT IS NOT SO HE IS CONTENTING HIS OWN SPIRIT
FIRSTTHE OTHERS PERSONS BENEFIT HAS TO ALWAYS TAKE SECOND PLACE

YM WHAT A FANTASTIC IDEA WHAT BECOMES OF SELFSACRIFICE PLEASE
ANSWER ME THAT

OM WHAT IS SELFSACRIFICE

YM THE DOING GOOD TO ANOTHER PERSON WHERE NO SHADOW NOR SUGGESTION OF
BENEFIT TO ONES SELF CAN RESULT FROM IT

II

MANS SOLE IMPULSETHE SECURING OF HIS OWN APPROVAL

OLD MAN THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES OF ITYOU THINK

YOUNG MAN INSTANCES MILLIONS OF THEM

OM YOU HAVE NOT JUMPED TO CONCLUSIONS YOU HAVE EXAMINED
THEMCRITICALLY

YM THEY DONT NEED IT THE ACTS THEMSELVES REVEAL THE GOLDEN IMPULSE
BACK OF THEM

OM FOR INSTANCE

YM WELL THEN FOR INSTANCE TAKE THE CASE IN THE BOOK HERE THE MAN
LIVES THREE MILES UPTOWN IT IS BITTER COLD SNOWING HARD MIDNIGHT
HE IS ABOUT TO ENTER THE HORSECAR WHEN A GRAY AND RAGGED OLD WOMAN A
TOUCHING PICTURE OF MISERY PUTS OUT HER LEAN HAND AND BEGS FOR RESCUE
FROM HUNGER AND DEATH THE MAN FINDS THAT HE HAS A QUARTER IN HIS
POCKET BUT HE DOES NOT HESITATE HE GIVES IT HER AND TRUDGES HOME
THROUGH THE STORM THEREIT IS NOBLE IT IS BEAUTIFUL ITS GRACE IS
MARRED BY NO FLECK OR BLEMISH OR SUGGESTION OF SELFINTEREST

OM WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT

YM PRAY WHAT ELSE COULD I THINK DO YOU IMAGINE THAT THERE IS SOME
OTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IT

OM CAN YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THE MANS PLACE AND TELL ME WHAT HE FELT
AND WHAT HE THOUGHT

YM EASILY THE SIGHT OF THAT SUFFERING OLD FACE PIERCED HIS GENEROUS
HEART WITH A SHARP PAIN HE COULD NOT BEAR IT HE COULD ENDURE THE
THREEMILE WALK IN THE STORM BUT HE COULD NOT ENDURE THE TORTURES HIS
CONSCIENCE WOULD SUFFER IF HE TURNED HIS BACK AND LEFT THAT POOR OLD
CREATURE TO PERISH HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP FOR THINKING
OF IT

OM WHAT WAS HIS STATE OF MIND ON HIS WAY HOME

YM IT WAS A STATE OF JOY WHICH ONLY THE SELFSACRIFICER KNOWS HIS
HEART SANG HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS OF THE STORM

OM HE FELT WELL

YM ONE CANNOT DOUBT IT

OM VERY WELL NOW LET US ADD UP THE DETAILS AND SEE HOW MUCH HE GOT
FOR HIS TWENTYFIVE CENTS LET US TRY TO FIND OUT THE REAL WHY OF HIS
MAKING THE INVESTMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE HE COULDNT BEAR THE PAIN
WHICH THE OLD SUFFERING FACE GAVE HIM SO HE WAS THINKING OF HIS
PAINTHIS GOOD MAN HE MUST BUY A SALVE FOR IT IF HE DID NOT SUCCOR
THE OLD WOMAN HIS CONSCIENCE WOULD TORTURE HIM ALL THE WAY HOME
THINKING OF HIS PAIN AGAIN HE MUST BUY RELIEF FOR THAT IF HE DIDNT
RELIEVE THE OLD WOMAN HE WOULD NOT GET ANY SLEEP HE MUST BUY SOME
SLEEPSTILL THINKING OF HIMSELF YOU SEE THUS TO SUM UP HE BOUGHT
HIMSELF FREE OF A SHARP PAIN IN HIS HEART HE BOUGHT HIMSELF FREE OF
THE TORTURES OF A WAITING CONSCIENCE HE BOUGHT A WHOLE NIGHTS
SLEEPALL FOR TWENTYFIVE CENTS IT SHOULD MAKE WALL STREET ASHAMED OF
ITSELF ON HIS WAY HOME HIS HEART WAS JOYFUL AND IT SANGPROFIT ON TOP
OF PROFIT THE IMPULSE WHICH MOVED THE MAN TO SUCCOR THE OLD WOMAN
WASFIRSTTO CONTENT HIS OWN SPIRIT SECONDLY TO RELIEVE HER
SUFFERINGS IS IT YOUR OPINION THAT MENS ACTS PROCEED FROM ONE CENTRAL
AND UNCHANGING AND INALTERABLE IMPULSE OR FROM A VARIETY OF IMPULSES

YM FROM A VARIETY OF COURSESOME HIGH AND FINE AND NOBLE OTHERS
NOT WHAT IS YOUR OPINION

OM THEN THERE IS BUT ONE LAW ONE SOURCE

YM THAT BOTH THE NOBLEST IMPULSES AND THE BASEST PROCEED FROM THAT
ONE SOURCE

OM YES

YM WILL YOU PUT THAT LAW INTO WORDS

OM YES THIS IS THE LAW KEEP IT IN YOUR MIND FROM HIS CRADLE TO
HIS GRAVE A MAN NEVER DOES A SINGLE THING WHICH HAS ANY FIRST AND
FOREMOST OBJECT BUT ONETO SECURE PEACE OF MIND SPIRITUAL
COMFORT FOR HIMSELF

YM COME HE NEVER DOES ANYTHING FOR ANY ONE ELSES COMFORT SPIRITUAL
OR PHYSICAL

OM NO EXCEPT ON THOSE DISTINCT TERMSTHAT IT SHALL FIRST SECURE
HIS OWN SPIRITUAL COMFORT OTHERWISE HE WILL NOT DO IT

YM IT WILL BE EASY TO EXPOSE THE FALSITY OF THAT PROPOSITION

OM FOR INSTANCE

YM TAKE THAT NOBLE PASSION LOVE OF COUNTRY PATRIOTISM A MAN WHO
LOVES PEACE AND DREADS PAIN LEAVES HIS PLEASANT HOME AND HIS WEEPING
FAMILY AND MARCHES OUT TO MANFULLY EXPOSE HIMSELF TO HUNGER COLD
WOUNDS AND DEATH IS THAT SEEKING SPIRITUAL COMFORT

OM HE LOVES PEACE AND DREADS PAIN

YM YES

OM THEN PERHAPS THERE IS SOMETHING THAT HE LOVES MORE THAN HE LOVES
PEACETHE APPROVAL OF HIS NEIGHBORS AND THE PUBLIC AND PERHAPS THERE
IS SOMETHING WHICH HE DREADS MORE THAN HE DREADS PAINTHE DISAPPROVAL
OF HIS NEIGHBORS AND THE PUBLIC IF HE IS SENSITIVE TO SHAME HE WILL GO
TO THE FIELDNOT BECAUSE HIS SPIRIT WILL BE ENTIRELY COMFORTABLE
THERE BUT BECAUSE IT WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE THERE THAN IT WOULD BE
IF HE REMAINED AT HOME HE WILL ALWAYS DO THE THING WHICH WILL BRING
HIM THE MOST MENTAL COMFORTFOR THAT IS THE SOLE LAW OF HIS LIFE
HE LEAVES THE WEEPING FAMILY BEHIND HE IS SORRY TO MAKE THEM
UNCOMFORTABLE BUT NOT SORRY ENOUGH TO SACRIFICE HIS OWN COMFORT TO
SECURE THEIRS

YM DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT MERE PUBLIC OPINION COULD FORCE A TIMID
AND PEACEFUL MAN TO

OM GO TO WAR YESPUBLIC OPINION CAN FORCE SOME MEN TO DO ANYTHING

YM ANYTHING

OM YESANYTHING

YM I DONT BELIEVE THAT CAN IT FORCE A RIGHTPRINCIPLED MAN TO DO A
WRONG THING

OM YES

YM CAN IT FORCE A KIND MAN TO DO A CRUEL THING

OM YES

YM GIVE AN INSTANCE

OM ALEXANDER HAMILTON WAS A CONSPICUOUSLY HIGHPRINCIPLED MAN HE
REGARDED DUELING AS WRONG AND AS OPPOSED TO THE TEACHINGS OF
RELIGIONBUT IN DEFERENCE TO PUBLIC OPINION HE FOUGHT A DUEL HE
DEEPLY LOVED HIS FAMILY BUT TO BUY PUBLIC APPROVAL HE TREACHEROUSLY
DESERTED THEM AND THREW HIS LIFE AWAY UNGENEROUSLY LEAVING THEM TO
LIFELONG SORROW IN ORDER THAT HE MIGHT STAND WELL WITH A FOOLISH WORLD
IN THE THEN CONDITION OF THE PUBLIC STANDARDS OF HONOR HE COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN COMFORTABLE WITH THE STIGMA UPON HIM OF HAVING REFUSED TO
FIGHT THE TEACHINGS OF RELIGION HIS DEVOTION TO HIS FAMILY HIS
KINDNESS OF HEART HIS HIGH PRINCIPLES ALL WENT FOR NOTHING WHEN THEY
STOOD IN THE WAY OF HIS SPIRITUAL COMFORT A MAN WILL DO ANYTHING NO
MATTER WHAT IT IS TO SECURE HIS SPIRITUAL COMFORT AND HE CAN
NEITHER BE FORCED NOR PERSUADED TO ANY ACT WHICH HAS NOT THAT GOAL FOR
ITS OBJECT HAMILTONS ACT WAS COMPELLED BY THE INBORN NECESSITY OF
CONTENTING HIS OWN SPIRIT IN THIS IT WAS LIKE ALL THE OTHER ACTS OF
HIS LIFE AND LIKE ALL THE ACTS OF ALL MENS LIVES DO YOU SEE WHERE
THE KERNEL OF THE MATTER LIES A MAN CANNOT BE COMFORTABLE WITHOUT HIS
OWN APPROVAL HE WILL SECURE THE LARGEST SHARE POSSIBLE OF THAT AT
ALL COSTS ALL SACRIFICES

YM A MINUTE AGO YOU SAID HAMILTON FOUGHT THAT DUEL TO GET PUBLIC
APPROVAL

OM I DID BY REFUSING TO FIGHT THE DUEL HE WOULD HAVE SECURED HIS
FAMILYS APPROVAL AND A LARGE SHARE OF HIS OWN BUT THE PUBLIC APPROVAL
WAS MORE VALUABLE IN HIS EYES THAN ALL OTHER APPROVALS PUT TOGETHERIN
THE EARTH OR ABOVE IT TO SECURE THAT WOULD FURNISH HIM THE MOST
COMFORT OF MIND THE MOST SELFAPPROVAL SO HE SACRIFICED ALL OTHER
VALUES TO GET IT

YM SOME NOBLE SOULS HAVE REFUSED TO FIGHT DUELS AND HAVE MANFULLY
BRAVED THE PUBLIC CONTEMPT

OM THEY ACTED ACCORDING TO THEIR MAKE THEY VALUED THEIR PRINCIPLES
AND THE APPROVAL OF THEIR FAMILIES ABOVE THE PUBLIC APPROVAL THEY
TOOK THE THING THEY VALUED MOST AND LET THE REST GO THEY TOOK WHAT
WOULD GIVE THEM THE LARGEST SHARE OF PERSONAL CONTENTMENT AND
APPROVALA MAN ALWAYS DOES PUBLIC OPINION CANNOT FORCE THAT KIND OF
MEN TO GO TO THE WARS WHEN THEY GO IT IS FOR OTHER REASONS OTHER
SPIRITCONTENTING REASONS

YM ALWAYS SPIRITCONTENTING REASONS

OM THERE ARE NO OTHERS

YM WHEN A MAN SACRIFICES HIS LIFE TO SAVE A LITTLE CHILD FROM A
BURNING BUILDING WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT

OM WHEN HE DOES IT IT IS THE LAW OF HIS MAKE HE CANT BEAR TO
SEE THE CHILD IN THAT PERIL A MAN OF A DIFFERENT MAKE COULD AND SO
HE TRIES TO SAVE THE CHILD AND LOSES HIS LIFE BUT HE HAS GOT WHAT HE
WAS AFTERHIS OWN APPROVAL

YM WHAT DO YOU CALL LOVE HATE CHARITY REVENGE HUMANITY
MAGNANIMITY FORGIVENESS

OM DIFFERENT RESULTS OF THE ONE MASTER IMPULSE THE NECESSITY OF
SECURING ONES SELF APPROVAL THEY WEAR DIVERSE CLOTHES AND ARE SUBJECT
TO DIVERSE MOODS BUT IN WHATSOEVER WAYS THEY MASQUERADE THEY ARE THE
SAME PERSON ALL THE TIME TO CHANGE THE FIGURE THE COMPULSION THAT
MOVES A MANAND THERE IS BUT THE ONEIS THE NECESSITY OF SECURING THE
CONTENTMENT OF HIS OWN SPIRIT WHEN IT STOPS THE MAN IS DEAD

YM THAT IS FOOLISHNESS LOVE

OM WHY LOVE IS THAT IMPULSE THAT LAW IN ITS MOST UNCOMPROMISING
FORM IT WILL SQUANDER LIFE AND EVERYTHING ELSE ON ITS OBJECT NOT
PRIMARILY FOR THE OBJECTS SAKE BUT FOR ITS OWN WHEN ITS OBJECT
IS HAPPY IT IS HAPPYAND THAT IS WHAT IT IS UNCONSCIOUSLY AFTER

YM YOU DO NOT EVEN EXCEPT THE LOFTY AND GRACIOUS PASSION OF
MOTHERLOVE

OM NO IT IS THE ABSOLUTE SLAVE OF THAT LAW THE MOTHER WILL GO
NAKED TO CLOTHE HER CHILD SHE WILL STARVE THAT IT MAY HAVE FOOD
SUFFER TORTURE TO SAVE IT FROM PAIN DIE THAT IT MAY LIVE SHE TAKES A
LIVING PLEASURE IN MAKING THESE SACRIFICES SHE DOES IT FOR THAT
REWARDTHAT SELFAPPROVAL THAT CONTENTMENT THAT PEACE THAT COMFORT
SHE WOULD DO IT FOR YOUR CHILD IF SHE COULD GET THE SAME PAY

YM THIS IS AN INFERNAL PHILOSOPHY OF YOURS

OM IT ISNT A PHILOSOPHY IT IS A FACT

YM OF COURSE YOU MUST ADMIT THAT THERE ARE SOME ACTS WHICH

OM NO THERE IS NO ACT LARGE OR SMALL FINE OR MEAN WHICH SPRINGS
FROM ANY MOTIVE BUT THE ONETHE NECESSITY OF APPEASING AND CONTENTING
ONES OWN SPIRIT

YM THE WORLDS PHILANTHROPISTS

OM I HONOR THEM I UNCOVER MY HEAD TO THEMFROM HABIT AND TRAINING
AND THEY COULD NOT KNOW COMFORT OR HAPPINESS OR SELFAPPROVAL IF THEY
DID NOT WORK AND SPEND FOR THE UNFORTUNATE IT MAKES THEM HAPPY TO
SEE OTHERS HAPPY AND SO WITH MONEY AND LABOR THEY BUY WHAT THEY ARE
AFTERHAPPINESS SELFAPPROVAL WHY DONT MINERS DO THE SAME THING
BECAUSE THEY CAN GET A THOUSANDFOLD MORE HAPPINESS BY NOT DOING IT
THERE IS NO OTHER REASON THEY FOLLOW THE LAW OF THEIR MAKE

YM WHAT DO YOU SAY OF DUTY FOR DUTYS SAKE

OM THAT IT DOES NOT EXIST DUTIES ARE NOT PERFORMED FOR DUTYS
SAKE BUT BECAUSE THEIR NEGLECT WOULD MAKE THE MAN UNCOMFORTABLE
A MAN PERFORMS BUT ONE DUTYTHE DUTY OF CONTENTING HIS SPIRIT THE
DUTY OF MAKING HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO HIMSELF IF HE CAN MOST
SATISFYINGLY PERFORM THIS SOLE AND ONLY DUTY BY HELPING HIS NEIGHBOR
HE WILL DO IT IF HE CAN MOST SATISFYINGLY PERFORM IT BY SWINDLING
HIS NEIGHBOR HE WILL DO IT BUT HE ALWAYS LOOKS OUT FOR NUMBER
ONEFIRST THE EFFECTS UPON OTHERS ARE A SECONDARY MATTER MEN
PRETEND TO SELFSACRIFICES BUT THIS IS A THING WHICH IN THE ORDINARY
VALUE OF THE PHRASE DOES NOT EXIST AND HAS NOT EXISTED A MAN OFTEN
HONESTLY THINKS HE IS SACRIFICING HIMSELF MERELY AND SOLELY FOR SOME
ONE ELSE BUT HE IS DECEIVED HIS BOTTOM IMPULSE IS TO CONTENT A
REQUIREMENT OF HIS NATURE AND TRAINING AND THUS ACQUIRE PEACE FOR HIS
SOUL

YM APPARENTLY THEN ALL MEN BOTH GOOD AND BAD ONES DEVOTE THEIR
LIVES TO CONTENTING THEIR CONSCIENCES

OM YES THAT IS A GOOD ENOUGH NAME FOR IT CONSCIENCETHAT
INDEPENDENT SOVEREIGN THAT INSOLENT ABSOLUTE MONARCH INSIDE OF A MAN
WHO IS THE MANS MASTER THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF CONSCIENCES BECAUSE
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF MEN YOU SATISFY AN ASSASSINS CONSCIENCE IN ONE
WAY A PHILANTHROPISTS IN ANOTHER A MISERS IN ANOTHER A BURGLARS
IN STILL ANOTHER AS A GUIDE OR INCENTIVE TO ANY AUTHORITATIVELY
PRESCRIBED LINE OF MORALS OR CONDUCT LEAVING TRAINING OUT OF THE
ACCOUNT A MANS CONSCIENCE IS TOTALLY VALUELESS I KNOW A
KINDHEARTED KENTUCKIAN WHOSE SELFAPPROVAL WAS LACKINGWHOSE
CONSCIENCE WAS TROUBLING HIM TO PHRASE IT WITH EXACTNESSBECAUSE HE
HAD NEGLECTED TO KILL A CERTAIN MANA MAN WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN THE
STRANGER HAD KILLED THIS MANS FRIEND IN A FIGHT THIS MANS KENTUCKY
TRAINING MADE IT A DUTY TO KILL THE STRANGER FOR IT HE NEGLECTED HIS
DUTYKEPT DODGING IT SHIRKING IT PUTTING IT OFF AND HIS UNRELENTING
CONSCIENCE KEPT PERSECUTING HIM FOR THIS CONDUCT AT LAST TO GET EASE
OF MIND COMFORT SELFAPPROVAL HE HUNTED UP THE STRANGER AND TOOK HIS
LIFE IT WAS AN IMMENSE ACT OF SELFSACRIFICE AS PER THE USUAL
DEFINITION FOR HE DID NOT WANT TO DO IT AND HE NEVER WOULD HAVE DONE
IT IF HE COULD HAVE BOUGHT A CONTENTED SPIRIT AND AN UNWORRIED MIND AT
SMALLER COST BUT WE ARE SO MADE THAT WE WILL PAY ANYTHING FOR THAT
CONTENTMENTEVEN ANOTHER MANS LIFE

YM YOU SPOKE A MOMENT AGO OF TRAINED CONSCIENCES YOU MEAN THAT WE
ARE NOT BORN WITH CONSCIENCES COMPETENT TO GUIDE US ARIGHT

OM IF WE WERE CHILDREN AND SAVAGES WOULD KNOW RIGHT FROM WRONG AND
NOT HAVE TO BE TAUGHT IT

YM BUT CONSCIENCES CAN BE TRAINED

OM YES

YM OF COURSE BY PARENTS TEACHERS THE PULPIT AND BOOKS

OM YESTHEY DO THEIR SHARE THEY DO WHAT THEY CAN

YM AND THE REST IS DONE BY

OM OH A MILLION UNNOTICED INFLUENCESFOR GOOD OR BAD INFLUENCES
WHICH WORK WITHOUT REST DURING EVERY WAKING MOMENT OF A MANS LIFE
FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE

YM YOU HAVE TABULATED THESE

OM MANY OF THEMYES

YM WILL YOU READ ME THE RESULT

OM ANOTHER TIME YES IT WOULD TAKE AN HOUR

YM A CONSCIENCE CAN BE TRAINED TO SHUN EVIL AND PREFER GOOD

OM YES

YM BUT WILL IT FOR SPIRITCONTENTING REASONS ONLY

OM IT CANT BE TRAINED TO DO A THING FOR ANY OTHER REASON THE
THING IS IMPOSSIBLE

YM THERE MUST BE A GENUINELY AND UTTERLY SELFSACRIFICING ACT
RECORDED IN HUMAN HISTORY SOMEWHERE

OM YOU ARE YOUNG YOU HAVE MANY YEARS BEFORE YOU SEARCH ONE OUT

YM IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT WHEN A MAN SEES A FELLOWBEING STRUGGLING
IN THE WATER AND JUMPS IN AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE TO SAVE HIM

OM WAIT DESCRIBE THE MAN DESCRIBE THE FELLOWBEING STATE IF
THERE IS AN AUDIENCE PRESENT OR IF THEY ARE ALONE

YM WHAT HAVE THESE THINGS TO DO WITH THE SPLENDID ACT

OM VERY MUCH SHALL WE SUPPOSE AS A BEGINNING THAT THE TWO ARE
ALONE IN A SOLITARY PLACE AT MIDNIGHT

YM IF YOU CHOOSE

OM AND THAT THE FELLOWBEING IS THE MANS DAUGHTER

YM WELL NNOMAKE IT SOMEONE ELSE

OM A FILTHY DRUNKEN RUFFIAN THEN

YM I SEE CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER CASES I SUPPOSE THAT IF THERE WAS NO
AUDIENCE TO OBSERVE THE ACT THE MAN WOULDNT PERFORM IT

OM BUT THERE IS HERE AND THERE A MAN WHO WOULD PEOPLE FOR
INSTANCE LIKE THE MAN WHO LOST HIS LIFE TRYING TO SAVE THE CHILD FROM
THE FIRE AND THE MAN WHO GAVE THE NEEDY OLD WOMAN HIS TWENTYFIVE
CENTS AND WALKED HOME IN THE STORMTHERE ARE HERE AND THERE MEN LIKE
THAT WHO WOULD DO IT AND WHY BECAUSE THEY COULDNT BEAR TO SEE A
FELLOWBEING STRUGGLING IN THE WATER AND NOT JUMP IN AND HELP IT WOULD
GIVE THEM PAIN THEY WOULD SAVE THE FELLOWBEING ON THAT ACCOUNT
THEY WOULDNT DO IT OTHERWISE THEY STRICTLY OBEY THE LAW WHICH I
HAVE BEEN INSISTING UPON YOU MUST REMEMBER AND ALWAYS DISTINGUISH THE
PEOPLE WHO CANT BEAR THINGS FROM PEOPLE WHO CAN IT WILL THROW
LIGHT UPON A NUMBER OF APPARENTLY SELFSACRIFICING CASES

YM OH DEAR ITS ALL SO DISGUSTING

OM YES AND SO TRUE

YM COMETAKE THE GOOD BOY WHO DOES THINGS HE DOESNT WANT TO DO IN
ORDER TO GRATIFY HIS MOTHER

OM HE DOES SEVENTENTHS OF THE ACT BECAUSE IT GRATIFIES HIM TO
GRATIFY HIS MOTHER THROW THE BULK OF ADVANTAGE THE OTHER WAY AND THE
GOOD BOY WOULD NOT DO THE ACT HE MUST OBEY THE IRON LAW NONE CAN
ESCAPE IT

YM WELL TAKE THE CASE OF A BAD BOY WHO

OM YOU NEEDNT MENTION IT IT IS A WASTE OF TIME IT IS NO MATTER
ABOUT THE BAD BOYS ACT WHATEVER IT WAS HE HAD A SPIRITCONTENTING
REASON FOR IT OTHERWISE YOU HAVE BEEN MISINFORMED AND HE DIDNT DO
IT

YM IT IS VERY EXASPERATING A WHILE AGO YOU SAID THAT MANS
CONSCIENCE IS NOT A BORN JUDGE OF MORALS AND CONDUCT BUT HAS TO BE
TAUGHT AND TRAINED NOW I THINK A CONSCIENCE CAN GET DROWSY AND LAZY
BUT I DONT THINK IT CAN GO WRONG IF YOU WAKE IT UP

A LITTLE STORY

OM I WILL TELL YOU A LITTLE STORY

ONCE UPON A TIME AN INFIDEL WAS GUEST IN THE HOUSE OF A CHRISTIAN WIDOW
WHOSE LITTLE BOY WAS ILL AND NEAR TO DEATH THE INFIDEL OFTEN WATCHED
BY THE BEDSIDE AND ENTERTAINED THE BOY WITH TALK AND HE USED THESE
OPPORTUNITIES TO SATISFY A STRONG LONGING IN HIS NATURETHAT DESIRE
WHICH IS IN US ALL TO BETTER OTHER PEOPLES CONDITION BY HAVING THEM
THINK AS WE THINK HE WAS SUCCESSFUL BUT THE DYING BOY IN HIS LAST
MOMENTS REPROACHED HIM AND SAID

I BELIEVED AND WAS HAPPY IN IT YOU HAVE TAKEN MY BELIEF AWAY AND
MY COMFORT NOW I HAVE NOTHING LEFT AND I DIE MISERABLE FOR THE
THINGS WHICH YOU HAVE TOLD ME DO NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF THAT WHICH I
HAVE LOST

AND THE MOTHER ALSO REPROACHED THE INFIDEL AND SAID

MY CHILD IS FOREVER LOST AND MY HEART IS BROKEN HOW COULD YOU DO
THIS CRUEL THING WE HAVE DONE YOU NO HARM BUT ONLY KINDNESS WE MADE
OUR HOUSE YOUR HOME YOU WERE WELCOME TO ALL WE HAD AND THIS IS OUR
REWARD

THE HEART OF THE INFIDEL WAS FILLED WITH REMORSE FOR WHAT HE HAD DONE
AND HE SAID

IT WAS WRONGI SEE IT NOW BUT I WAS ONLY TRYING TO DO HIM GOOD IN
MY VIEW HE WAS IN ERROR IT SEEMED MY DUTY TO TEACH HIM THE TRUTH

THEN THE MOTHER SAID

I HAD TAUGHT HIM ALL HIS LITTLE LIFE WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THE
TRUTH AND IN HIS BELIEVING FAITH BOTH OF US WERE HAPPY NOW HE IS
DEADAND LOST AND I AM MISERABLE OUR FAITH CAME DOWN TO US THROUGH
CENTURIES OF BELIEVING ANCESTORS WHAT RIGHT HAD YOU OR ANY ONE TO
DISTURB IT WHERE WAS YOUR HONOR WHERE WAS YOUR SHAME

YM HE WAS A MISCREANT AND DESERVED DEATH

OM HE THOUGHT SO HIMSELF AND SAID SO

YM AHYOU SEE HIS CONSCIENCE WAS AWAKENED

OM YES HIS SELFDISAPPROVAL WAS IT PAINED HIM TO SEE THE MOTHER
SUFFER HE WAS SORRY HE HAD DONE A THING WHICH BROUGHT HIM PAIN IT
DID NOT OCCUR TO HIM TO THINK OF THE MOTHER WHEN HE WAS MISTEACHING THE
BOY FOR HE WAS ABSORBED IN PROVIDING PLEASURE FOR HIMSELF THEN
PROVIDING IT BY SATISFYING WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE A CALL OF DUTY

YM CALL IT WHAT YOU PLEASE IT IS TO ME A CASE OF AWAKENED
CONSCIENCE THAT AWAKENED CONSCIENCE COULD NEVER GET ITSELF INTO THAT
SPECIES OF TROUBLE AGAIN A CURE LIKE THAT IS A PERMANENT CURE

OM PARDONI HAD NOT FINISHED THE STORY WE ARE CREATURES OF OUTSIDE
INFLUENCESWE ORIGINATE NOTHING WITHIN WHENEVER WE TAKE A NEW LINE
OF THOUGHT AND DRIFT INTO A NEW LINE OF BELIEF AND ACTION THE IMPULSE
IS ALWAYS SUGGESTED FROM THE OUTSIDE REMORSE SO PREYED UPON THE
INFIDEL THAT IT DISSOLVED HIS HARSHNESS TOWARD THE BOYS RELIGION AND
MADE HIM COME TO REGARD IT WITH TOLERANCE NEXT WITH KINDNESS FOR THE
BOYS SAKE AND THE MOTHERS FINALLY HE FOUND HIMSELF EXAMINING IT
FROM THAT MOMENT HIS PROGRESS IN HIS NEW TREND WAS STEADY AND RAPID HE
BECAME A BELIEVING CHRISTIAN AND NOW HIS REMORSE FOR HAVING ROBBED THE
DYING BOY OF HIS FAITH AND HIS SALVATION WAS BITTERER THAN EVER IT
GAVE HIM NO REST NO PEACE HE MUST HAVE REST AND PEACEIT IS THE LAW
OF NATURE THERE SEEMED BUT ONE WAY TO GET IT HE MUST DEVOTE HIMSELF
TO SAVING IMPERILED SOULS HE BECAME A MISSIONARY HE LANDED IN A PAGAN
COUNTRY ILL AND HELPLESS A NATIVE WIDOW TOOK HIM INTO HER HUMBLE HOME
AND NURSED HIM BACK TO CONVALESCENCE THEN HER YOUNG BOY WAS TAKEN
HOPELESSLY ILL AND THE GRATEFUL MISSIONARY HELPED HER TEND HIM HERE
WAS HIS FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO REPAIR A PART OF THE WRONG DONE TO THE
OTHER BOY BY DOING A PRECIOUS SERVICE FOR THIS ONE BY UNDERMINING HIS
FOOLISH FAITH IN HIS FALSE GODS HE WAS SUCCESSFUL BUT THE DYING BOY
IN HIS LAST MOMENTS REPROACHED HIM AND SAID

I BELIEVED AND WAS HAPPY IN IT YOU HAVE TAKEN MY BELIEF AWAY AND
MY COMFORT NOW I HAVE NOTHING LEFT AND I DIE MISERABLE FOR THE
THINGS WHICH YOU HAVE TOLD ME DO NOT TAKE THE PLACE OF THAT WHICH I
HAVE LOST

AND THE MOTHER ALSO REPROACHED THE MISSIONARY AND SAID

MY CHILD IS FOREVER LOST AND MY HEART IS BROKEN HOW COULD YOU DO
THIS CRUEL THING WE HAD DONE YOU NO HARM BUT ONLY KINDNESS WE MADE
OUR HOUSE YOUR HOME YOU WERE WELCOME TO ALL WE HAD AND THIS IS OUR
REWARD

THE HEART OF THE MISSIONARY WAS FILLED WITH REMORSE FOR WHAT HE HAD
DONE AND HE SAID

IT WAS WRONGI SEE IT NOW BUT I WAS ONLY TRYING TO DO HIM GOOD IN
MY VIEW HE WAS IN ERROR IT SEEMED MY DUTY TO TEACH HIM THE TRUTH

THEN THE MOTHER SAID

I HAD TAUGHT HIM ALL HIS LITTLE LIFE WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THE
TRUTH AND IN HIS BELIEVING FAITH BOTH OF US WERE HAPPY NOW HE IS
DEADAND LOST AND I AM MISERABLE OUR FAITH CAME DOWN TO US THROUGH
CENTURIES OF BELIEVING ANCESTORS WHAT RIGHT HAD YOU OR ANY ONE TO
DISTURB IT WHERE WAS YOUR HONOR WHERE WAS YOUR SHAME

THE MISSIONARYS ANGUISH OF REMORSE AND SENSE OF TREACHERY WERE AS
BITTER AND PERSECUTING AND UNAPPEASABLE NOW AS THEY HAD BEEN IN THE
FORMER CASE THE STORY IS FINISHED WHAT IS YOUR COMMENT

YM THE MANS CONSCIENCE IS A FOOL IT WAS MORBID IT DIDNT KNOW
RIGHT FROM WRONG

OM I AM NOT SORRY TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT IF YOU GRANT THAT ONE MANS
CONSCIENCE DOESNT KNOW RIGHT FROM WRONG IT IS AN ADMISSION THAT THERE
ARE OTHERS LIKE IT THIS SINGLE ADMISSION PULLS DOWN THE WHOLE DOCTRINE
OF INFALLIBILITY OF JUDGMENT IN CONSCIENCES MEANTIME THERE IS ONE
THING WHICH I ASK YOU TO NOTICE

YM WHAT IS THAT

OM THAT IN BOTH CASES THE MANS ACT GAVE HIM NO SPIRITUAL
DISCOMFORT AND THAT HE WAS QUITE SATISFIED WITH IT AND GOT PLEASURE
OUT OF IT BUT AFTERWARD WHEN IT RESULTED IN PAIN TO HIM HE WAS
SORRY SORRY IT HAD INFLICTED PAIN UPON THE OTHERS BUT FOR NO REASON
UNDER THE SUN EXCEPT THAT THEIR PAIN GAVE HIM PAIN OUR CONSCIENCES
TAKE NO NOTICE OF PAIN INFLICTED UPON OTHERS UNTIL IT REACHES A POINT
WHERE IT GIVES PAIN TO US IN ALL CASES WITHOUT EXCEPTION WE ARE
ABSOLUTELY INDIFFERENT TO ANOTHER PERSONS PAIN UNTIL HIS SUFFERINGS
MAKE US UNCOMFORTABLE MANY AN INFIDEL WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TROUBLED BY
THAT CHRISTIAN MOTHERS DISTRESS DONT YOU BELIEVE THAT

YM YES YOU MIGHT ALMOST SAY IT OF THE AVERAGE INFIDEL I THINK

OM AND MANY A MISSIONARY STERNLY FORTIFIED BY HIS SENSE OF DUTY
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TROUBLED BY THE PAGAN MOTHERS DISTRESSJESUIT
MISSIONARIES IN CANADA IN THE EARLY FRENCH TIMES FOR INSTANCE SEE
EPISODES QUOTED BY PARKMAN

YM WELL LET US ADJOURN WHERE HAVE WE ARRIVED

OM AT THIS THAT WE MANKIND HAVE TICKETED OURSELVES WITH A NUMBER
OF QUALITIES TO WHICH WE HAVE GIVEN MISLEADING NAMES LOVE HATE
CHARITY COMPASSION AVARICE BENEVOLENCE AND SO ON I MEAN WE ATTACH
MISLEADING MEANINGS TO THE NAMES THEY ARE ALL FORMS OF
SELFCONTENTMENT SELFGRATIFICATION BUT THE NAMES SO DISGUISE THEM
THAT THEY DISTRACT OUR ATTENTION FROM THE FACT ALSO WE HAVE SMUGGLED A
WORD INTO THE DICTIONARY WHICH OUGHT NOT TO BE THERE AT
ALLSELFSACRIFICE IT DESCRIBES A THING WHICH DOES NOT EXIST BUT
WORST OF ALL WE IGNORE AND NEVER MENTION THE SOLE IMPULSE WHICH
DICTATES AND COMPELS A MANS EVERY ACT THE IMPERIOUS NECESSITY OF
SECURING HIS OWN APPROVAL IN EVERY EMERGENCY AND AT ALL COSTS TO IT
WE OWE ALL THAT WE ARE IT IS OUR BREATH OUR HEART OUR BLOOD IT IS
OUR ONLY SPUR OUR WHIP OUR GOAD OUR ONLY IMPELLING POWER WE HAVE NO
OTHER WITHOUT IT WE SHOULD BE MERE INERT IMAGES CORPSES NO ONE WOULD
DO ANYTHING THERE WOULD BE NO PROGRESS THE WORLD WOULD STAND STILL
WE OUGHT TO STAND REVERENTLY UNCOVERED WHEN THE NAME OF THAT STUPENDOUS
POWER IS UTTERED

YM I AM NOT CONVINCED

OM YOU WILL BE WHEN YOU THINK

III

INSTANCES IN POINT

OLD MAN HAVE YOU GIVEN THOUGHT TO THE GOSPEL OF SELFAPPROVAL SINCE WE
TALKED

YOUNG MAN I HAVE

OM IT WAS I THAT MOVED YOU TO IT THAT IS TO SAY AN OUTSIDE
INFLUENCE MOVED YOU TO ITNOT ONE THAT ORIGINATED IN YOUR HEAD WILL
YOU TRY TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AND NOT FORGET IT

YM YES WHY

OM BECAUSE BY AND BY IN ONE OF OUR TALKS I WISH TO FURTHER IMPRESS
UPON YOU THAT NEITHER YOU NOR I NOR ANY MAN EVER ORIGINATES A THOUGHT
IN HIS OWN HEAD THE UTTERER OF A THOUGHT ALWAYS UTTERS A SECONDHAND
ONE

YM OH NOW

OM WAIT RESERVE YOUR REMARK TILL WE GET TO THAT PART OF OUR
DISCUSSIONTOMORROW OR NEXT DAY SAY NOW THEN HAVE YOU BEEN
CONSIDERING THE PROPOSITION THAT NO ACT IS EVER BORN OF ANY BUT A
SELFCONTENTING IMPULSEPRIMARILY YOU HAVE SOUGHT WHAT HAVE YOU
FOUND

YM I HAVE NOT BEEN VERY FORTUNATE I HAVE EXAMINED MANY FINE AND
APPARENTLY SELFSACRIFICING DEEDS IN ROMANCES AND BIOGRAPHIES BUT

OM UNDER SEARCHING ANALYSIS THE OSTENSIBLE SELFSACRIFICE
DISAPPEARED IT NATURALLY WOULD

YM BUT HERE IN THIS NOVEL IS ONE WHICH SEEMS TO PROMISE IN THE
ADIRONDACK WOODS IS A WAGEEARNER AND LAY PREACHER IN THE LUMBERCAMPS
WHO IS OF NOBLE CHARACTER AND DEEPLY RELIGIOUS AN EARNEST AND
PRACTICAL LABORER IN THE NEW YORK SLUMS COMES UP THERE ON VACATIONHE
IS LEADER OF A SECTION OF THE UNIVERSITY SETTLEMENT HOLME THE
LUMBERMAN IS FIRED WITH A DESIRE TO THROW AWAY HIS EXCELLENT WORLDLY
PROSPECTS AND GO DOWN AND SAVE SOULS ON THE EAST SIDE HE COUNTS IT
HAPPINESS TO MAKE THIS SACRIFICE FOR THE GLORY OF GOD AND FOR THE CAUSE
OF CHRIST HE RESIGNS HIS PLACE MAKES THE SACRIFICE CHEERFULLY AND
GOES TO THE EAST SIDE AND PREACHES CHRIST AND HIM CRUCIFIED EVERY DAY
AND EVERY NIGHT TO LITTLE GROUPS OF HALFCIVILIZED FOREIGN PAUPERS WHO
SCOFF AT HIM BUT HE REJOICES IN THE SCOFFINGS SINCE HE IS SUFFERING
THEM IN THE GREAT CAUSE OF CHRIST YOU HAVE SO FILLED MY MIND WITH
SUSPICIONS THAT I WAS CONSTANTLY EXPECTING TO FIND A HIDDEN
QUESTIONABLE IMPULSE BACK OF ALL THIS BUT I AM THANKFUL TO SAY I HAVE
FAILED THIS MAN SAW HIS DUTY AND FOR DUTYS SAKE HE SACRIFICED SELF
AND ASSUMED THE BURDEN IT IMPOSED

OM IS THAT AS FAR AS YOU HAVE READ

YM YES

OM LET US READ FURTHER PRESENTLY MEANTIME IN SACRIFICING
HIMSELFNOT FOR THE GLORY OF GOD PRIMARILY AS HE IMAGINED BUT
FIRST TO CONTENT THAT EXACTING AND INFLEXIBLE MASTER WITHIN HIMDID
HE SACRIFICE ANYBODY ELSE

YM HOW DO YOU MEAN

OM HE RELINQUISHED A LUCRATIVE POST AND GOT MERE FOOD AND LODGING IN
PLACE OF IT HAD HE DEPENDENTS

YM WELLYES

OM IN WHAT WAY AND TO WHAT EXTEND DID HIS SELFSACRIFICE AFFECT
THEM

YM HE WAS THE SUPPORT OF A SUPERANNUATED FATHER HE HAD A YOUNG
SISTER WITH A REMARKABLE VOICEHE WAS GIVING HER A MUSICAL EDUCATION
SO THAT HER LONGING TO BE SELFSUPPORTING MIGHT BE GRATIFIED HE WAS
FURNISHING THE MONEY TO PUT A YOUNG BROTHER THROUGH A POLYTECHNIC
SCHOOL AND SATISFY HIS DESIRE TO BECOME A CIVIL ENGINEER

OM THE OLD FATHERS COMFORTS WERE NOW CURTAILED

YM QUITE SERIOUSLY YES

OM THE SISTERS MUSICLESSENS HAD TO STOP

YM YES

OM THE YOUNG BROTHERS EDUCATIONWELL AN EXTINGUISHING BLIGHT FELL
UPON THAT HAPPY DREAM AND HE HAD TO GO TO SAWING WOOD TO SUPPORT THE
OLD FATHER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

YM IT IS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED YES

OM WHAT A HANDSOME JOB OF SELFSACRIFICING HE DID DO IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT HE SACRIFICED EVERYBODY EXCEPT HIMSELF HAVENT I TOLD YOU THAT
NO MAN EVER SACRIFICES HIMSELF THAT THERE IS NO INSTANCE OF IT UPON
RECORD ANYWHERE AND THAT WHEN A MANS INTERIOR MONARCH REQUIRES A
THING OF ITS SLAVE FOR EITHER ITS MOMENTARY OR ITS PERMANENT
CONTENTMENT THAT THING MUST AND WILL BE FURNISHED AND THAT COMMAND
OBEYED NO MATTER WHO MAY STAND IN THE WAY AND SUFFER DISASTER BY IT
THAT MAN RUINED HIS FAMILY TO PLEASE AND CONTENT HIS INTERIOR
MONARCH

YM AND HELP CHRISTS CAUSE

OM YESSECONDLY NOT FIRSTLY HE THOUGHT IT WAS FIRSTLY

YM VERY WELL HAVE IT SO IF YOU WILL BUT IT COULD BE THAT HE ARGUED
THAT IF HE SAVED A HUNDRED SOULS IN NEW YORK

OM THE SACRIFICE OF THE FAMILY WOULD BE JUSTIFIED BY THAT GREAT
PROFIT UPON THETHEWHAT SHALL WE CALL IT

YM INVESTMENT

OM HARDLY HOW WOULD SPECULATION DO HOW WOULD GAMBLE DO NOT A
SOLITARY SOULCAPTURE WAS SURE HE PLAYED FOR A POSSIBLE
THIRTYTHREEHUNDREDPERCENT PROFIT IT WAS GAMBLINGWITH HIS FAMILY
FOR CHIPS HOWEVER LET US SEE HOW THE GAME CAME OUT MAYBE WE CAN GET
ON THE TRACK OF THE SECRET ORIGINAL IMPULSE THE REAL IMPULSE THAT
MOVED HIM TO SO NOBLY SELFSACRIFICE HIS FAMILY IN THE SAVIORS CAUSE
UNDER THE SUPERSTITION THAT HE WAS SACRIFICING HIMSELF I WILL READ A
CHAPTER OR SO HERE WE HAVE IT IT WAS BOUND TO EXPOSE ITSELF SOONER
OR LATER HE PREACHED TO THE EASTSIDE RABBLE A SEASON THEN WENT BACK
TO HIS OLD DULL OBSCURE LIFE IN THE LUMBERCAMPS HURT TO THE HEART
HIS PRIDE HUMBLED WHY WERE NOT HIS EFFORTS ACCEPTABLE TO THE
SAVIOR FOR WHOM ALONE THEY WERE MADE DEAR ME THAT DETAIL IS LOST
SIGHT OF IS NOT EVEN REFERRED TO THE FACT THAT IT STARTED OUT AS A
MOTIVE IS ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN THEN WHAT IS THE TROUBLE THE AUTHORESS
QUITE INNOCENTLY AND UNCONSCIOUSLY GIVES THE WHOLE BUSINESS AWAY THE
TROUBLE WAS THIS THIS MAN MERELY PREACHED TO THE POOR THAT IS NOT
THE UNIVERSITY SETTLEMENTS WAY IT DEALS IN LARGER AND BETTER THINGS
THAN THAT AND IT DID NOT ENTHUSE OVER THAT CRUDE SALVATIONARMY
ELOQUENCE IT WAS COURTEOUS TO HOLMEBUT COOL IT DID NOT PET HIM DID
NOT TAKE HIM TO ITS BOSOM PERISHED WERE ALL HIS DREAMS OF
DISTINCTION THE PRAISE AND GRATEFUL APPROVAL OF WHOM THE SAVIOR
NO THE SAVIOR IS NOT MENTIONED OF WHOM THEN OF HIS
FELLOWWORKERS WHY DID HE WANT THAT BECAUSE THE MASTER INSIDE OF
HIM WANTED IT AND WOULD NOT BE CONTENT WITHOUT IT THAT EMPHASIZED
SENTENCE QUOTED ABOVE REVEALS THE SECRET WE HAVE BEEN SEEKING THE
ORIGINAL IMPULSE THE REAL IMPULSE WHICH MOVED THE OBSCURE AND
UNAPPRECIATED ADIRONDACK LUMBERMAN TO SACRIFICE HIS FAMILY AND GO ON
THAT CRUSADE TO THE EAST SIDEWHICH SAID ORIGINAL IMPULSE WAS THIS TO
WIT WITHOUT KNOWING IT HE WENT THERE TO SHOW A NEGLECTED WORLD THE
LARGE TALENT THAT WAS IN HIM AND RISE TO DISTINCTION AS I HAVE
WARNED YOU BEFORE NO ACT SPRINGS FROM ANY BUT THE ONE LAW THE ONE
MOTIVE BUT I PRAY YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS LAW UPON MY SAYSO BUT
DILIGENTLY EXAMINE FOR YOURSELF WHENEVER YOU READ OF A
SELFSACRIFICING ACT OR HEAR OF ONE OR OF A DUTY DONE FOR DUTYS
SAKE TAKE IT TO PIECES AND LOOK FOR THE REAL MOTIVE IT IS ALWAYS
THERE

YM I DO IT EVERY DAY I CANNOT HELP IT NOW THAT I HAVE GOTTEN
STARTED UPON THE DEGRADING AND EXASPERATING QUEST FOR IT IS HATEFULLY
INTERESTINGIN FACT FASCINATING IS THE WORD AS SOON AS I COME ACROSS
A GOLDEN DEED IN A BOOK I HAVE TO STOP AND TAKE IT APART AND EXAMINE
IT I CANNOT HELP MYSELF

OM HAVE YOU EVER FOUND ONE THAT DEFEATED THE RULE

YM NOAT LEAST NOT YET BUT TAKE THE CASE OF SERVANTTIPPING IN
EUROPE YOU PAY THE HOTEL FOR SERVICE YOU OWE THE SERVANTS
NOTHING YET YOU PAY THEM BESIDES DOESNT THAT DEFEAT IT

OM IN WHAT WAY

YM YOU ARE NOT OBLIGED TO DO IT THEREFORE ITS SOURCE IS COMPASSION
FOR THEIR ILLPAID CONDITION AND

OM HAS THAT CUSTOM EVER VEXED YOU ANNOYED YOU IRRITATED YOU

YM WELL YES

OM STILL YOU SUCCUMBED TO IT

YM OF COURSE

OM WHY OF COURSE

YM WELL CUSTOM IS LAW IN A WAY AND LAWS MUST BE SUBMITTED
TOEVERYBODY RECOGNIZES IT AS A DUTY

OM THEN YOU PAY FOR THE IRRITATING TAX FOR DUTYS SAKE

YM I SUPPOSE IT AMOUNTS TO THAT

OM THEN THE IMPULSE WHICH MOVES YOU TO SUBMIT TO THE TAX IS NOT ALL
COMPASSION CHARITY BENEVOLENCE

YM WELLPERHAPS NOT

OM IS ANY OF IT

YM IPERHAPS I WAS TOO HASTY IN LOCATING ITS SOURCE

OM PERHAPS SO IN CASE YOU IGNORED THE CUSTOM WOULD YOU GET PROMPT
AND EFFECTIVE SERVICE FROM THE SERVANTS

YM OH HEAR YOURSELF TALK THOSE EUROPEAN SERVANTS WHY YOU WOULDNT
GET ANY AT ALL TO SPEAK OF

OM COULDNT THAT WORK AS AN IMPULSE TO MOVE YOU TO PAY THE TAX

YM I AM NOT DENYING IT

OM APPARENTLY THEN IT IS A CASE OF FORDUTYSSAKE WITH A LITTLE
SELFINTEREST ADDED

YM YES IT HAS THE LOOK OF IT BUT HERE IS A POINT WE PAY THAT TAX
KNOWING IT TO BE UNJUST AND AN EXTORTION YET WE GO AWAY WITH A PAIN AT
THE HEART IF WE THINK WE HAVE BEEN STINGY WITH THE POOR FELLOWS AND WE
HEARTILY WISH WE WERE BACK AGAIN SO THAT WE COULD DO THE RIGHT THING
AND MORE THAN THE RIGHT THING THE GENEROUS THING I THINK IT WILL
BE DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO FIND ANY THOUGHT OF SELF IN THAT IMPULSE

OM I WONDER WHY YOU SHOULD THINK SO WHEN YOU FIND SERVICE CHARGED IN
THE HOTEL BILL DOES IT ANNOY YOU

YM NO

OM DO YOU EVER COMPLAIN OF THE AMOUNT OF IT

YM NO IT WOULD NOT OCCUR TO ME

OM THE EXPENSE THEN IS NOT THE ANNOYING DETAIL IT IS A FIXED
CHARGE AND YOU PAY IT CHEERFULLY YOU PAY IT WITHOUT A MURMUR WHEN
YOU CAME TO PAY THE SERVANTS HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF EACH OF THE MEN
AND MAIDS HAD A FIXED CHARGE

YM LIKE IT I SHOULD REJOICE

OM EVEN IF THE FIXED TAX WERE A SHADE MORE THAN YOU HAD BEEN IN THE
HABIT OF PAYING IN THE FORM OF TIPS

YM INDEED YES

OM VERY WELL THEN AS I UNDERSTAND IT IT ISNT REALLY COMPASSION
NOR YET DUTY THAT MOVES YOU TO PAY THE TAX AND IT ISNT THE AMOUNT
OF THE TAX THAT ANNOYS YOU YET SOMETHING ANNOYS YOU WHAT IS IT

YM WELL THE TROUBLE IS YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT TO PAY THE TAX VARIES
SO ALL OVER EUROPE

OM SO YOU HAVE TO GUESS

YM THERE IS NO OTHER WAY SO YOU GO ON THINKING AND THINKING AND
CALCULATING AND GUESSING AND CONSULTING WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND GETTING
THEIR VIEWS AND IT SPOILS YOUR SLEEP NIGHTS AND MAKES YOU DISTRAUGHT
IN THE DAYTIME AND WHILE YOU ARE PRETENDING TO LOOK AT THE SIGHTS YOU
ARE ONLY GUESSING AND GUESSING AND GUESSING ALL THE TIME AND BEING
WORRIED AND MISERABLE

OM AND ALL ABOUT A DEBT WHICH YOU DONT OWE AND DONT HAVE TO PAY
UNLESS YOU WANT TO STRANGE WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE GUESSING

YM TO GUESS OUT WHAT IS RIGHT TO GIVE THEM AND NOT BE UNFAIR TO ANY
OF THEM

OM IT HAS QUITE A NOBLE LOOKTAKING SO MUCH PAINS AND USING UP SO
MUCH VALUABLE TIME IN ORDER TO BE JUST AND FAIR TO A POOR SERVANT TO
WHOM YOU OWE NOTHING BUT WHO NEEDS MONEY AND IS ILL PAID

YM I THINK MYSELF THAT IF THERE IS ANY UNGRACIOUS MOTIVE BACK OF IT
IT WILL BE HARD TO FIND

OM HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE NOT PAID A SERVANT FAIRLY

YM WHY HE IS SILENT DOES NOT THANK YOU SOMETIMES HE GIVES YOU A
LOOK THAT MAKES YOU ASHAMED YOU ARE TOO PROUD TO RECTIFY YOUR MISTAKE
THERE WITH PEOPLE LOOKING BUT AFTERWARD YOU KEEP ON WISHING AND
WISHING YOU HAD DONE IT MY THE SHAME AND THE PAIN OF IT SOMETIMES
YOU SEE BY THE SIGNS THAT YOU HAVE IT JUST RIGHT AND YOU GO AWAY
MIGHTILY SATISFIED SOMETIMES THE MAN IS SO EFFUSIVELY THANKFUL THAT
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE GIVEN HIM A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN WAS NECESSARY

OM NECESSARY NECESSARY FOR WHAT

YM TO CONTENT HIM

OM HOW DO YOU FEEL THEN

YM REPENTANT

OM IT IS MY BELIEF THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN CONCERNING YOURSELF IN
GUESSING OUT HIS JUST DUES BUT ONLY IN CIPHERING OUT WHAT WOULD
CONTENT HIM AND I THINK YOU HAVE A SELFDELUDING REASON FOR THAT

YM WHAT WAS IT

OM IF YOU FELL SHORT OF WHAT HE WAS EXPECTING AND WANTING YOU WOULD
GET A LOOK WHICH WOULD SHAME YOU BEFORE FOLK THAT WOULD GIVE YOU
PAIN YOUFOR YOU ARE ONLY WORKING FOR YOURSELF NOT HIM IF YOU
GAVE HIM TOO MUCH YOU WOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF FOR IT AND THAT
WOULD GIVE YOU PAINANOTHER CASE OF THINKING OF YOURSELF
PROTECTING YOURSELF SAVING YOURSELF FROM DISCOMFORT YOU NEVER THINK
OF THE SERVANT ONCEEXCEPT TO GUESS OUT HOW TO GET HIS APPROVAL IF
YOU GET THAT YOU GET YOUR OWN APPROVAL AND THAT IS THE SOLE AND
ONLY THING YOU ARE AFTER THE MASTER INSIDE OF YOU IS THEN SATISFIED
CONTENTED COMFORTABLE THERE WAS NO OTHER THING AT STAKE AS A
MATTER OF FIRST INTEREST ANYWHERE IN THE TRANSACTION

FURTHER INSTANCES

YM WELL TO THINK OF IT SELFSACRIFICE FOR OTHERS THE GRANDEST
THING IN MAN RULED OUT NONEXISTENT

OM ARE YOU ACCUSING ME OF SAYING THAT

YM WHY CERTAINLY

OM I HAVENT SAID IT

YM WHAT DID YOU SAY THEN

OM THAT NO MAN HAS EVER SACRIFICED HIMSELF IN THE COMMON MEANING OF
THAT PHRASEWHICH IS SELFSACRIFICE FOR ANOTHER ALONE MEN MAKE
DAILY SACRIFICES FOR OTHERS BUT IT IS FOR THEIR OWN SAKE FIRST THE
ACT MUST CONTENT THEIR OWN SPIRIT FIRST THE OTHER BENEFICIARIES COME
SECOND

YM AND THE SAME WITH DUTY FOR DUTYS SAKE

OM YES NO MAN PERFORMS A DUTY FOR MERE DUTYS SAKE THE ACT MUST
CONTENT HIS SPIRIT FIRST HE MUST FEEL BETTER FOR DOING THE DUTY
THAN HE WOULD FOR SHIRKING IT OTHERWISE HE WILL NOT DO IT

YM TAKE THE CASE OF THE BERKELEY CASTLE

OM IT WAS A NOBLE DUTY GREATLY PERFORMED TAKE IT TO PIECES AND
EXAMINE IT IF YOU LIKE

YM A BRITISH TROOPSHIP CROWDED WITH SOLDIERS AND THEIR WIVES AND
CHILDREN SHE STRUCK A ROCK AND BEGAN TO SINK THERE WAS ROOM IN THE
BOATS FOR THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN ONLY THE COLONEL LINED UP HIS
REGIMENT ON THE DECK AND SAID IT IS OUR DUTY TO DIE THAT THEY MAY BE
SAVED THERE WAS NO MURMUR NO PROTEST THE BOATS CARRIED AWAY THE
WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHEN THE DEATHMOMENT WAS COME THE COLONEL AND HIS
OFFICERS TOOK THEIR SEVERAL POSTS THE MEN STOOD AT SHOULDERARMS AND
SO AS ON DRESSPARADE WITH THEIR FLAG FLYING AND THE DRUMS BEATING
THEY WENT DOWN A SACRIFICE TO DUTY FOR DUTYS SAKE CAN YOU VIEW IT AS
OTHER THAN THAT

OM IT WAS SOMETHING AS FINE AS THAT AS EXALTED AS THAT COULD YOU
HAVE REMAINED IN THOSE RANKS AND GONE DOWN TO YOUR DEATH IN THAT
UNFLINCHING WAY

YM COULD I NO I COULD NOT

OM THINK IMAGINE YOURSELF THERE WITH THAT WATERY DOOM CREEPING
HIGHER AND HIGHER AROUND YOU

YM I CAN IMAGINE IT I FEEL ALL THE HORROR OF IT I COULD NOT HAVE
ENDURED IT I COULD NOT HAVE REMAINED IN MY PLACE I KNOW IT

OM WHY

YM THERE IS NO WHY ABOUT IT I KNOW MYSELF AND I KNOW I COULDNT
DO IT

OM BUT IT WOULD BE YOUR DUTY TO DO IT

YM YES I KNOWBUT I COULDNT

OM IT WAS MORE THAN THOUSAND MEN YET NOT ONE OF THEM FLINCHED SOME
OF THEM MUST HAVE BEEN BORN WITH YOUR TEMPERAMENT IF THEY COULD DO
THAT GREAT DUTY FOR DUTYS SAKE WHY NOT YOU DONT YOU KNOW THAT YOU
COULD GO OUT AND GATHER TOGETHER A THOUSAND CLERKS AND MECHANICS AND
PUT THEM ON THAT DECK AND ASK THEM TO DIE FOR DUTYS SAKE AND NOT TWO
DOZEN OF THEM WOULD STAY IN THE RANKS TO THE END

YM YES I KNOW THAT

OM BUT YOU TRAIN THEM AND PUT THEM THROUGH A CAMPAIGN OR TWO THEN
THEY WOULD BE SOLDIERS SOLDIERS WITH A SOLDIERS PRIDE A SOLDIERS
SELFRESPECT A SOLDIERS IDEALS THEY WOULD HAVE TO CONTENT A
SOLDIERS SPIRIT THEN NOT A CLERKS NOT A MECHANICS THEY COULD
NOT CONTENT THAT SPIRIT BY SHIRKING A SOLDIERS DUTY COULD THEY

YM I SUPPOSE NOT

OM THEN THEY WOULD DO THE DUTY NOT FOR THE DUTYS SAKE BUT FOR
THEIR OWN SAKEPRIMARILY THE DUTY WAS JUST THE SAME AND JUST AS
IMPERATIVE WHEN THEY WERE CLERKS MECHANICS RAW RECRUITS BUT THEY
WOULDNT PERFORM IT FOR THAT AS CLERKS AND MECHANICS THEY HAD OTHER
IDEALS ANOTHER SPIRIT TO SATISFY AND THEY SATISFIED IT THEY HAD
TO IT IS THE LAW TRAINING IS POTENT TRAINING TOWARD HIGHER AND
HIGHER AND EVER HIGHER IDEALS IS WORTH ANY MANS THOUGHT AND LABOR AND
DILIGENCE

YM CONSIDER THE MAN WHO STANDS BY HIS DUTY AND GOES TO THE STAKE
RATHER THAN BE RECREANT TO IT

OM IT IS HIS MAKE AND HIS TRAINING HE HAS TO CONTENT THE SPIRIT THAT
IS IN HIM THOUGH IT COST HIM HIS LIFE ANOTHER MAN JUST AS SINCERELY
RELIGIOUS BUT OF DIFFERENT TEMPERAMENT WILL FAIL OF THAT DUTY THOUGH
RECOGNIZING IT AS A DUTY AND GRIEVING TO BE UNEQUAL TO IT BUT HE MUST
CONTENT THE SPIRIT THAT IS IN HIMHE CANNOT HELP IT HE COULD NOT
PERFORM THAT DUTY FOR DUTYS SAKE FOR THAT WOULD NOT CONTENT HIS
SPIRIT AND THE CONTENTING OF HIS SPIRIT MUST BE LOOKED TO FIRST IT
TAKES PRECEDENCE OF ALL OTHER DUTIES

YM TAKE THE CASE OF A CLERGYMAN OF STAINLESS PRIVATE MORALS WHO VOTES
FOR A THIEF FOR PUBLIC OFFICE ON HIS OWN PARTYS TICKET AND AGAINST
AN HONEST MAN ON THE OTHER TICKET

OM HE HAS TO CONTENT HIS SPIRIT HE HAS NO PUBLIC MORALS HE HAS NO
PRIVATE ONES WHERE HIS PARTYS PROSPERITY IS AT STAKE HE WILL ALWAYS
BE TRUE TO HIS MAKE AND TRAINING

IV

TRAINING

YOUNG MAN YOU KEEP USING THAT WORDTRAINING BY IT DO YOU PARTICULARLY
MEAN

OLD MAN STUDY INSTRUCTION LECTURES SERMONS THAT IS A PART OF
ITBUT NOT A LARGE PART I MEAN ALL THE OUTSIDE INFLUENCES THERE ARE
A MILLION OF THEM FROM THE CRADLE TO THE GRAVE DURING ALL HIS WAKING
HOURS THE HUMAN BEING IS UNDER TRAINING IN THE VERY FIRST RANK OF HIS
TRAINERS STANDS ASSOCIATION IT IS HIS HUMAN ENVIRONMENT WHICH
INFLUENCES HIS MIND AND HIS FEELINGS FURNISHES HIM HIS IDEALS AND
SETS HIM ON HIS ROAD AND KEEPS HIM IN IT IF HE LEAVES THAT ROAD HE
WILL FIND HIMSELF SHUNNED BY THE PEOPLE WHOM HE MOST LOVES AND ESTEEMS
AND WHOSE APPROVAL HE MOST VALUES HE IS A CHAMELEON BY THE LAW OF HIS
NATURE HE TAKES THE COLOR OF HIS PLACE OF RESORT THE INFLUENCES ABOUT
HIM CREATE HIS PREFERENCES HIS AVERSIONS HIS POLITICS HIS TASTES
HIS MORALS HIS RELIGION HE CREATES NONE OF THESE THINGS FOR HIMSELF
HE THINKS HE DOES BUT THAT IS BECAUSE HE HAS NOT EXAMINED INTO THE
MATTER YOU HAVE SEEN PRESBYTERIANS

YM MANY

OM HOW DID THEY HAPPEN TO BE PRESBYTERIANS AND NOT
CONGREGATIONALISTS AND WHY WERE THE CONGREGATIONALISTS NOT BAPTISTS
AND THE BAPTISTS ROMAN CATHOLICS AND THE ROMAN CATHOLICS BUDDHISTS
AND THE BUDDHISTS QUAKERS AND THE QUAKERS EPISCOPALIANS AND THE
EPISCOPALIANS MILLERITES AND THE MILLERITES HINDUS AND THE HINDUS
ATHEISTS AND THE ATHEISTS SPIRITUALISTS AND THE SPIRITUALISTS
AGNOSTICS AND THE AGNOSTICS METHODISTS AND THE METHODISTS CONFUCIANS

MOHAMMEDANS SALVATION WARRIORS AND THE SALVATION WARRIORS
ZOROASTRIANS AND THE ZOROASTRIANS CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS AND THE
CHRISTIAN SCIENTISTS MORMONSAND SO ON

YM YOU MAY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YOURSELF

OM THAT LIST OF SECTS IS NOT A RECORD OF STUDIES SEARCHINGS
SEEKINGS AFTER LIGHT IT MAINLY AND SARCASTICALLY INDICATES WHAT
ASSOCIATION CAN DO IF YOU KNOW A MANS NATIONALITY YOU CAN COME
WITHIN A SPLIT HAIR OF GUESSING THE COMPLEXION OF HIS RELIGION
ENGLISHPROTESTANT AMERICANDITTO SPANIARD FRENCHMAN IRISHMAN
ITALIAN SOUTH AMERICANROMAN CATHOLIC RUSSIANGREEK CATHOLIC
TURKMOHAMMEDAN AND SO ON AND WHEN YOU KNOW THE MANS RELIGIOUS
COMPLEXION YOU KNOW WHAT SORT OF RELIGIOUS BOOKS HE READS WHEN HE
WANTS SOME MORE LIGHT AND WHAT SORT OF BOOKS HE AVOIDS LEST BY
ACCIDENT HE GET MORE LIGHT THAN HE WANTS IN AMERICA IF YOU KNOW WHICH
PARTYCOLLAR A VOTER WEARS YOU KNOW WHAT HIS ASSOCIATIONS ARE AND HOW
HE CAME BY HIS POLITICS AND WHICH BREED OF NEWSPAPER HE READS TO GET
LIGHT AND WHICH BREED HE DILIGENTLY AVOIDS AND WHICH BREED OF
MASSMEETINGS HE ATTENDS IN ORDER TO BROADEN HIS POLITICAL KNOWLEDGE
AND WHICH BREED OF MASSMEETINGS HE DOESNT ATTEND EXCEPT TO REFUTE
ITS DOCTRINES WITH BRICKBATS WE ARE ALWAYS HEARING OF PEOPLE WHO ARE
AROUND SEEKING AFTER TRUTH I HAVE NEVER SEEN A PERMANENT SPECIMEN
I THINK HE HAD NEVER LIVED BUT I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL ENTIRELY SINCERE
PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE PERMANENT SEEKERS AFTER TRUTH THEY
SOUGHT DILIGENTLY PERSISTENTLY CAREFULLY CAUTIOUSLY PROFOUNDLY
WITH PERFECT HONESTY AND NICELY ADJUSTED JUDGMENTUNTIL THEY BELIEVED
THAT WITHOUT DOUBT OR QUESTION THEY HAD FOUND THE TRUTH THAT WAS THE
END OF THE SEARCH THE MAN SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFE HUNTING UP
SHINGLES WHEREWITH TO PROTECT HIS TRUTH FROM THE WEATHER IF HE WAS
SEEKING AFTER POLITICAL TRUTH HE FOUND IT IN ONE OR ANOTHER OF THE
HUNDRED POLITICAL GOSPELS WHICH GOVERN MEN IN THE EARTH IF HE WAS
SEEKING AFTER THE ONLY TRUE RELIGION HE FOUND IT IN ONE OR ANOTHER OF
THE THREE THOUSAND THAT ARE ON THE MARKET IN ANY CASE WHEN HE FOUND
THE TRUTH HE SOUGHT NO FURTHER BUT FROM THAT DAY FORTH WITH HIS
SOLDERINGIRON IN ONE HAND AND HIS BLUDGEON IN THE OTHER HE TINKERED
ITS LEAKS AND REASONED WITH OBJECTORS THERE HAVE BEEN INNUMERABLE
TEMPORARY SEEKERS OF TRUTHHAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A PERMANENT ONE IN
THE VERY NATURE OF MAN SUCH A PERSON IS IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER TO DROP
BACK TO THE TEXTTRAINING ALL TRAINING IS ONE FORM OR ANOTHER OF
OUTSIDE INFLUENCE AND ASSOCIATION IS THE LARGEST PART OF IT A MAN
IS NEVER ANYTHING BUT WHAT HIS OUTSIDE INFLUENCES HAVE MADE HIM THEY
TRAIN HIM DOWNWARD OR THEY TRAIN HIM UPWARDBUT THEY TRAIN HIM THEY
ARE AT WORK UPON HIM ALL THE TIME

YM THEN IF HE HAPPEN BY THE ACCIDENTS OF LIFE TO BE EVILLY PLACED
THERE IS NO HELP FOR HIM ACCORDING TO YOUR NOTIONSHE MUST TRAIN
DOWNWARD

OM NO HELP FOR HIM NO HELP FOR THIS CHAMELEON IT IS A MISTAKE IT
IS IN HIS CHAMELEONSHIP THAT HIS GREATEST GOOD FORTUNE LIES HE HAS
ONLY TO CHANGE HIS HABITATHIS ASSOCIATIONS BUT THE IMPULSE TO DO IT
MUST COME FROM THE OUTSIDE HE CANNOT ORIGINATE IT HIMSELF WITH THAT
PURPOSE IN VIEW SOMETIMES A VERY SMALL AND ACCIDENTAL THING CAN
FURNISH HIM THE INITIATORY IMPULSE AND START HIM ON A NEW ROAD WITH A
NEW IDEA THE CHANCE REMARK OF A SWEETHEART I HEAR THAT YOU ARE A
COWARD MAY WATER A SEED THAT SHALL SPROUT AND BLOOM AND FLOURISH AND
ENDED IN PRODUCING A SURPRISING FRUITAGEIN THE FIELDS OF WAR THE
HISTORY OF MAN IS FULL OF SUCH ACCIDENTS THE ACCIDENT OF A BROKEN LEG
BROUGHT A PROFANE AND RIBALD SOLDIER UNDER RELIGIOUS INFLUENCES AND
FURNISHED HIM A NEW IDEAL FROM THAT ACCIDENT SPRANG THE ORDER OF THE
JESUITS AND IT HAS BEEN SHAKING THRONES CHANGING POLICIES AND DOING
OTHER TREMENDOUS WORK FOR TWO HUNDRED YEARSAND WILL GO ON THE CHANCE
READING OF A BOOK OR OF A PARAGRAPH IN A NEWSPAPER CAN START A MAN ON A
NEW TRACK AND MAKE HIM RENOUNCE HIS OLD ASSOCIATIONS AND SEEK NEW ONES
THAT ARE IN SYMPATHY WITH HIS NEW IDEAL AND THE RESULT FOR THAT
MAN CAN BE AN ENTIRE CHANGE OF HIS WAY OF LIFE

YM ARE YOU HINTING AT A SCHEME OF PROCEDURE

OM NOT A NEW ONEAN OLD ONE OLD AS MANKIND

YM WHAT IS IT

OM MERELY THE LAYING OF TRAPS FOR PEOPLE TRAPS BAITED WITH
INITIATORY IMPULSES TOWARD HIGH IDEALS IT IS WHAT THE
TRACTDISTRIBUTOR DOES IT IS WHAT THE MISSIONARY DOES IT IS WHAT
GOVERNMENTS OUGHT TO DO

YM DONT THEY

OM IN ONE WAY THEY DO IN ANOTHER THEY DONT THEY SEPARATE THE
SMALLPOX PATIENTS FROM THE HEALTHY PEOPLE BUT IN DEALING WITH CRIME
THEY PUT THE HEALTHY INTO THE PESTHOUSE ALONG WITH THE SICK THAT IS
TO SAY THEY PUT THE BEGINNERS IN WITH THE CONFIRMED CRIMINALS THIS
WOULD BE WELL IF MAN WERE NATURALLY INCLINED TO GOOD BUT HE ISNT AND
SO ASSOCIATION MAKES THE BEGINNERS WORSE THAN THEY WERE WHEN THEY
WENT INTO CAPTIVITY IT IS PUTTING A VERY SEVERE PUNISHMENT UPON THE
COMPARATIVELY INNOCENT AT TIMES THEY HANG A MANWHICH IS A TRIFLING
PUNISHMENT THIS BREAKS THE HEARTS OF HIS FAMILYWHICH IS A HEAVY ONE
THEY COMFORTABLY JAIL AND FEED A WIFEBEATER AND LEAVE HIS INNOCENT
WIFE AND FAMILY TO STARVE

YM DO YOU BELIEVE IN THE DOCTRINE THAT MAN IS EQUIPPED WITH AN
INTUITIVE PERCEPTION OF GOOD AND EVIL

OM ADAM HADNT IT

YM BUT HAS MAN ACQUIRED IT SINCE

OM NO I THINK HE HAS NO INTUITIONS OF ANY KIND HE GETS ALL HIS
IDEAS ALL HIS IMPRESSIONS FROM THE OUTSIDE I KEEP REPEATING THIS IN
THE HOPE THAT I MAY IMPRESS IT UPON YOU THAT YOU WILL BE INTERESTED TO
OBSERVE AND EXAMINE FOR YOURSELF AND SEE WHETHER IT IS TRUE OR FALSE

YM WHERE DID YOU GET YOUR OWN AGGRAVATING NOTIONS

OM FROM THE OUTSIDE I DID NOT INVENT THEM THEY ARE GATHERED FROM
A THOUSAND UNKNOWN SOURCES MAINLY UNCONSCIOUSLY GATHERED

YM DONT YOU BELIEVE THAT GOD COULD MAKE AN INHERENTLY HONEST MAN

OM YES I KNOW HE COULD I ALSO KNOW THAT HE NEVER DID MAKE ONE

YM A WISER OBSERVER THAN YOU HAS RECORDED THE FACT THAT AN HONEST
MANS THE NOBLEST WORK OF GOD

OM HE DIDNT RECORD A FACT HE RECORDED A FALSITY IT IS WINDY AND
SOUNDS WELL BUT IT IS NOT TRUE GOD MAKES A MAN WITH HONEST AND
DISHONEST POSSIBILITIES IN HIM AND STOPS THERE THE MANS
ASSOCIATIONS DEVELOP THE POSSIBILITIESTHE ONE SET OR THE OTHER THE
RESULT IS ACCORDINGLY AN HONEST MAN OR A DISHONEST ONE

YM AND THE HONEST ONE IS NOT ENTITLED TO

OM PRAISE NO HOW OFTEN MUST I TELL YOU THAT HE IS NOT THE
ARCHITECT OF HIS HONESTY

YM NOW THEN I WILL ASK YOU WHERE THERE IS ANY SENSE IN TRAINING
PEOPLE TO LEAD VIRTUOUS LIVES WHAT IS GAINED BY IT

OM THE MAN HIMSELF GETS LARGE ADVANTAGES OUT OF IT AND THAT IS THE
MAIN THINGTO HIM HE IS NOT A PERIL TO HIS NEIGHBORS HE IS NOT A
DAMAGE TO THEMAND SO THEY GET AN ADVANTAGE OUT OF HIS VIRTUES THAT
IS THE MAIN THING TO THEM IT CAN MAKE THIS LIFE COMPARATIVELY
COMFORTABLE TO THE PARTIES CONCERNED THE NEGLECT OF THIS TRAINING
CAN MAKE THIS LIFE A CONSTANT PERIL AND DISTRESS TO THE PARTIES
CONCERNED

YM YOU HAVE SAID THAT TRAINING IS EVERYTHING THAT TRAINING IS THE
MAN HIMSELF FOR IT MAKES HIM WHAT HE IS

OM I SAID TRAINING AND ANOTHER THING LET THAT OTHER THING PASS
FOR THE MOMENT WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY

YM WE HAVE AN OLD SERVANT SHE HAS BEEN WITH US TWENTYTWO YEARS HER
SERVICE USED TO BE FAULTLESS BUT NOW SHE HAS BECOME VERY FORGETFUL WE
ARE ALL FOND OF HER WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT SHE CANNOT HELP THE
INFIRMITY WHICH AGE HAS BROUGHT HER THE REST OF THE FAMILY DO NOT
SCOLD HER FOR HER REMISSNESSES BUT AT TIMES I DOI CANT SEEM TO
CONTROL MYSELF DONT I TRY I DO TRY NOW THEN WHEN I WAS READY TO
DRESS THIS MORNING NO CLEAN CLOTHES HAD BEEN PUT OUT I LOST MY
TEMPER I LOSE IT EASIEST AND QUICKEST IN THE EARLY MORNING I RANG
AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO WARN MYSELF NOT TO SHOW TEMPER AND TO BE
CAREFUL AND SPEAK GENTLY I SAFEGUARDED MYSELF MOST CAREFULLY I EVEN
CHOSE THE VERY WORD I WOULD USE YOUVE FORGOTTEN THE CLEAN CLOTHES
JANE WHEN SHE APPEARED IN THE DOOR I OPENED MY MOUTH TO SAY THAT
PHRASEAND OUT OF IT MOVED BY AN INSTANT SURGE OF PASSION WHICH I WAS
NOT EXPECTING AND HADNT TIME TO PUT UNDER CONTROL CAME THE HOT
REBUKE YOUVE FORGOTTEN THEM AGAIN YOU SAY A MAN ALWAYS DOES THE
THING WHICH WILL BEST PLEASE HIS INTERIOR MASTER WHENCE CAME THE
IMPULSE TO MAKE CAREFUL PREPARATION TO SAVE THE GIRL THE HUMILIATION OF
A REBUKE DID THAT COME FROM THE MASTER WHO IS ALWAYS PRIMARILY
CONCERNED ABOUT HIMSELF

OM UNQUESTIONABLY THERE IS NO OTHER SOURCE FOR ANY IMPULSE
SECONDARILY YOU MADE PREPARATION TO SAVE THE GIRL BUT PRIMARILY
ITS OBJECT WAS TO SAVE YOURSELF BY CONTENTING THE MASTER

YM HOW DO YOU MEAN

OM HAS ANY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY EVER IMPLORED YOU TO WATCH YOUR
TEMPER AND NOT FLY OUT AT THE GIRL

YM YES MY MOTHER

OM YOU LOVE HER

YM OH MORE THAN THAT

OM YOU WOULD ALWAYS DO ANYTHING IN YOUR POWER TO PLEASE HER

YM IT IS A DELIGHT TO ME TO DO ANYTHING TO PLEASE HER

OM WHY YOU WOULD DO IT FOR PAY SOLELY FOR PROFIT WHAT PROFIT
WOULD YOU EXPECT AND CERTAINLY RECEIVE FROM THE INVESTMENT

YM PERSONALLY NONE TO PLEASE HER IS ENOUGH

OM IT APPEARS THEN THAT YOUR OBJECT PRIMARILY WASNT TO SAVE
THE GIRL A HUMILIATION BUT TO PLEASE YOUR MOTHER IT ALSO APPEARS
THAT TO PLEASE YOUR MOTHER GIVES YOU A STRONG PLEASURE IS NOT THAT
THE PROFIT WHICH YOU GET OUT OF THE INVESTMENT ISNT THAT THE REAL
PROFITS AND FIRST PROFIT

YM OH WELL GO ON

OM IN ALL TRANSACTIONS THE INTERIOR MASTER LOOKS TO IT THAT YOU
GET THE FIRST PROFIT OTHERWISE THERE IS NO TRANSACTION

YM WELL THEN IF I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO GET THAT PROFIT AND SO INTENT
UPON IT WHY DID I THROW IT AWAY BY LOSING MY TEMPER

OM IN ORDER TO GET ANOTHER PROFIT WHICH SUDDENLY SUPERSEDED IT IN
VALUE

YM WHERE WAS IT

OM AMBUSHED BEHIND YOUR BORN TEMPERAMENT AND WAITING FOR A CHANCE
YOUR NATIVE WARM TEMPER SUDDENLY JUMPED TO THE FRONT AND FOR THE
MOMENT ITS INFLUENCE WAS MORE POWERFUL THAN YOUR MOTHERS AND
ABOLISHED IT IN THAT INSTANCE YOU WERE EAGER TO FLASH OUT A HOT REBUKE
AND ENJOY IT YOU DID ENJOY IT DIDNT YOU

YM FORFOR A QUARTER OF A SECOND YESI DID

OM VERY WELL IT IS AS I HAVE SAID THE THING WHICH WILL GIVE YOU THE
MOST PLEASURE THE MOST SATISFACTION IN ANY MOMENT OR FRACTION OF
A MOMENT IS THE THING YOU WILL ALWAYS DO YOU MUST CONTENT THE
MASTERS LATEST WHIM WHATEVER IT MAY BE

YM BUT WHEN THE TEARS CAME INTO THE OLD SERVANTS EYES I COULD HAVE
CUT MY HAND OFF FOR WHAT I HAD DONE

OM RIGHT YOU HAD HUMILIATED YOURSELF YOU SEE YOU HAD GIVEN
YOURSELF PAIN NOTHING IS OF FIRST IMPORTANCE TO A MAN EXCEPT
RESULTS WHICH DAMAGE HIM OR PROFIT HIMALL THE REST IS SECONDARY
YOUR MASTER WAS DISPLEASED WITH YOU ALTHOUGH YOU HAD OBEYED HIM HE
REQUIRED A PROMPT REPENTANCE YOU OBEYED AGAIN YOU HAD TOTHERE IS
NEVER ANY ESCAPE FROM HIS COMMANDS HE IS A HARD MASTER AND FICKLE HE
CHANGES HIS MIND IN THE FRACTION OF A SECOND BUT YOU MUST BE READY TO
OBEY AND YOU WILL OBEY ALWAYS IF HE REQUIRES REPENTANCE YOU
CONTENT HIM YOU WILL ALWAYS FURNISH IT HE MUST BE NURSED PETTED
CODDLED AND KEPT CONTENTED LET THE TERMS BE WHAT THEY MAY

YM TRAINING OH WHATS THE USE OF IT DIDNT I AND DIDNT MY MOTHER
TRY TO TRAIN ME UP TO WHERE I WOULD NO LONGER FLY OUT AT THAT GIRL

OM HAVE YOU NEVER MANAGED TO KEEP BACK A SCOLDING

YM OH CERTAINLYMANY TIMES

OM MORE TIMES THIS YEAR THAN LAST

YM YES A GOOD MANY MORE

OM MORE TIMES LAST YEAR THAN THE YEAR BEFORE

YM YES

OM THERE IS A LARGE IMPROVEMENT THEN IN THE TWO YEARS

YM YES UNDOUBTEDLY

OM THEN YOUR QUESTION IS ANSWERED YOU SEE THERE IS USE IN
TRAINING KEEP ON KEEPING FAITHFULLY ON YOU ARE DOING WELL

YM WILL MY REFORM REACH PERFECTION

OM IT WILL UP TO YOUR LIMIT

YM MY LIMIT WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT

OM YOU REMEMBER THAT YOU SAID THAT I SAID TRAINING WAS EVERYTHING
I CORRECTED YOU AND SAID TRAINING AND ANOTHER THING THAT OTHER
THING IS TEMPERAMENT THAT IS THE DISPOSITION YOU WERE BORN WITH
YOU CANT ERADICATE YOUR DISPOSITION NOR ANY RAG OF IT YOU CAN ONLY
PUT A PRESSURE ON IT AND KEEP IT DOWN AND QUIET YOU HAVE A WARM
TEMPER

YM YES

OM YOU WILL NEVER GET RID OF IT BUT BY WATCHING IT YOU CAN KEEP IT
DOWN NEARLY ALL THE TIME ITS PRESENCE IS YOUR LIMIT YOUR REFORM
WILL NEVER QUITE REACH PERFECTION FOR YOUR TEMPER WILL BEAT YOU NOW
AND THEN BUT YOU COME NEAR ENOUGH YOU HAVE MADE VALUABLE PROGRESS AND
CAN MAKE MORE THERE IS USE IN TRAINING IMMENSE USE PRESENTLY YOU
WILL REACH A NEW STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT THEN YOUR PROGRESS WILL BE
EASIER WILL PROCEED ON A SIMPLER BASIS ANYWAY

YM EXPLAIN

OM YOU KEEP BACK YOUR SCOLDINGS NOW TO PLEASE YOURSELF BY PLEASING
YOUR MOTHER PRESENTLY THE MERE TRIUMPHING OVER YOUR TEMPER WILL
DELIGHT YOUR VANITY AND CONFER A MORE DELICIOUS PLEASURE AND
SATISFACTION UPON YOU THAN EVEN THE APPROBATION OF YOUR MOTHER
CONFERS UPON YOU NOW YOU WILL THEN LABOR FOR YOURSELF DIRECTLY AND AT
FIRST HAND NOT BY THE ROUNDABOUT WAY THROUGH YOUR MOTHER IT
SIMPLIFIES THE MATTER AND IT ALSO STRENGTHENS THE IMPULSE

YM AH DEAR BUT I SHANT EVER REACH THE POINT WHERE I WILL SPARE
THE GIRL FOR HER SAKE PRIMARILY NOT MINE

OM WHYYES IN HEAVEN

YM AFTER A REFLECTIVE PAUSE TEMPERAMENT WELL I SEE ONE MUST
ALLOW FOR TEMPERAMENT IT IS A LARGE FACTOR SURE ENOUGH MY MOTHER IS
THOUGHTFUL AND NOT HOTTEMPERED WHEN I WAS DRESSED I WENT TO HER
ROOM SHE WAS NOT THERE I CALLED SHE ANSWERED FROM THE BATHROOM I
HEARD THE WATER RUNNING I INQUIRED SHE ANSWERED WITHOUT TEMPER THAT
JANE HAD FORGOTTEN HER BATH AND SHE WAS PREPARING IT HERSELF I
OFFERED TO RING BUT SHE SAID NO DONT DO THAT IT WOULD ONLY
DISTRESS HER TO BE CONFRONTED WITH HER LAPSE AND WOULD BE A REBUKE
SHE DOESNT DESERVE THATSHE IS NOT TO BLAME FOR THE TRICKS HER MEMORY
SERVES HER I SAYHAS MY MOTHER AN INTERIOR MASTERAND WHERE WAS HE

OM HE WAS THERE THERE AND LOOKING OUT FOR HIS OWN PEACE AND
PLEASURE AND CONTENTMENT THE GIRLS DISTRESS WOULD HAVE PAINED YOUR
MOTHER OTHERWISE THE GIRL WOULD HAVE BEEN RUNG UP DISTRESS AND ALL
I KNOW WOMEN WHO WOULD HAVE GOTTEN A NO PLEASURE OUT OF RINGING
JANE UPAND SO THEY WOULD INFALLIBLY HAVE PUSHED THE BUTTON AND OBEYED
THE LAW OF THEIR MAKE AND TRAINING WHICH ARE THE SERVANTS OF THEIR
INTERIOR MASTERS IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT A PART OF YOUR MOTHERS
FORBEARANCE CAME FROM TRAINING THE GOOD KIND OF TRAININGWHOSE BEST
AND HIGHEST FUNCTION IS TO SEE TO IT THAT EVERY TIME IT CONFERS A
SATISFACTION UPON ITS PUPIL A BENEFIT SHALL FALL AT SECOND HAND UPON
OTHERS

YM IF YOU WERE GOING TO CONDENSE INTO AN ADMONITION YOUR PLAN FOR THE
GENERAL BETTERMENT OF THE RACES CONDITION HOW WOULD YOU WORD IT

ADMONITION

OM DILIGENTLY TRAIN YOUR IDEALS UPWARD AND STILL UPWARD TOWARD A
SUMMIT WHERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR CHIEFEST PLEASURE IN CONDUCT WHICH
WHILE CONTENTING YOU WILL BE SURE TO CONFER BENEFITS UPON YOUR
NEIGHBOR AND THE COMMUNITY

YM IS THAT A NEW GOSPEL

OM NO

YM IT HAS BEEN TAUGHT BEFORE

OM FOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS

YM BY WHOM

OM ALL THE GREAT RELIGIONSALL THE GREAT GOSPELS

YM THEN THERE IS NOTHING NEW ABOUT IT

OM OH YES THERE IS IT IS CANDIDLY STATED THIS TIME THAT HAS NOT
BEEN DONE BEFORE

YM HOW DO YOU MEAN

OM HAVENT I PUT YOU FIRST AND YOUR NEIGHBOR AND THE COMMUNITY
AFTERWARD

YM WELL YES THAT IS A DIFFERENCE IT IS TRUE

OM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STRAIGHT SPEAKING AND CROOKED THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FRANKNESS AND SHUFFLING

YM EXPLAIN

OM THE OTHERS OFFER YOU A HUNDRED BRIBES TO BE GOOD THUS CONCEDING
THAT THE MASTER INSIDE OF YOU MUST BE CONCILIATED AND CONTENTED FIRST
AND THAT YOU WILL DO NOTHING AT FIRST HAND BUT FOR HIS SAKE THEN
THEY TURN SQUARE AROUND AND REQUIRE YOU TO DO GOOD FOR OTHERS SAKE
CHIEFLY AND TO DO YOUR DUTY FOR DUTYS SAKE CHIEFLY AND TO DO
ACTS OF SELFSACRIFICE THUS AT THE OUTSET WE ALL STAND UPON THE
SAME GROUNDRECOGNITION OF THE SUPREME AND ABSOLUTE MONARCH THAT
RESIDES IN MAN AND WE ALL GROVEL BEFORE HIM AND APPEAL TO HIM THEN
THOSE OTHERS DODGE AND SHUFFLE AND FACE AROUND AND UNFRANKLY AND
INCONSISTENTLY AND ILLOGICALLY CHANGE THE FORM OF THEIR APPEAL AND
DIRECT ITS PERSUASIONS TO MANS SECONDPLACE POWERS AND TO POWERS
WHICH HAVE NO EXISTENCE IN HIM THUS ADVANCING THEM TO FIRST PLACE
WHEREAS IN MY ADMONITION I STICK LOGICALLY AND CONSISTENTLY TO THE
ORIGINAL POSITION I PLACE THE INTERIOR MASTERS REQUIREMENTS FIRST
AND KEEP THEM THERE

YM IF WE GRANT FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT YOUR SCHEME AND THE
OTHER SCHEMES AIM AT AND PRODUCE THE SAME RESULTRIGHT LIVINGHAS
YOURS AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE OTHERS

OM ONE YESA LARGE ONE IT HAS NO CONCEALMENTS NO DECEPTIONS WHEN
A MAN LEADS A RIGHT AND VALUABLE LIFE UNDER IT HE IS NOT DECEIVED AS TO
THE REAL CHIEF MOTIVE WHICH IMPELS HIM TO ITIN THOSE OTHER CASES HE
IS

YM IS THAT AN ADVANTAGE IS IT AN ADVANTAGE TO LIVE A LOFTY LIFE FOR
A MEAN REASON IN THE OTHER CASES HE LIVES THE LOFTY LIFE UNDER THE
IMPRESSION THAT HE IS LIVING FOR A LOFTY REASON IS NOT THAT AN
ADVANTAGE

OM PERHAPS SO THE SAME ADVANTAGE HE MIGHT GET OUT OF THINKING
HIMSELF A DUKE AND LIVING A DUKES LIFE AND PARADING IN DUCAL FUSS AND
FEATHERS WHEN HE WASNT A DUKE AT ALL AND COULD FIND IT OUT IF HE
WOULD ONLY EXAMINE THE HERALDS RECORDS

YM BUT ANYWAY HE IS OBLIGED TO DO A DUKES PART HE PUTS HIS HAND IN
HIS POCKET AND DOES HIS BENEVOLENCES ON AS BIG A SCALE AS HE CAN STAND
AND THAT BENEFITS THE COMMUNITY

OM HE COULD DO THAT WITHOUT BEING A DUKE

YM BUT WOULD HE

OM DONT YOU SEE WHERE YOU ARE ARRIVING

YM WHERE

OM AT THE STANDPOINT OF THE OTHER SCHEMES THAT IT IS GOOD MORALS TO
LET AN IGNORANT DUKE DO SHOWY BENEVOLENCES FOR HIS PRIDES SAKE A
PRETTY LOW MOTIVE AND GO ON DOING THEM UNWARNED LEST IF HE WERE MADE
ACQUAINTED WITH THE ACTUAL MOTIVE WHICH PROMPTED THEM HE MIGHT SHUT UP
HIS PURSE AND CEASE TO BE GOOD

YM BUT ISNT IT BEST TO LEAVE HIM IN IGNORANCE AS LONG AS HE THINKS
HE IS DOING GOOD FOR OTHERS SAKE

OM PERHAPS SO IT IS THE POSITION OF THE OTHER SCHEMES THEY THINK
HUMBUG IS GOOD ENOUGH MORALS WHEN THE DIVIDEND ON IT IS GOOD DEEDS AND
HANDSOME CONDUCT

YM IT IS MY OPINION THAT UNDER YOUR SCHEME OF A MANS DOING A GOOD
DEED FOR HIS OWN SAKE FIRSTOFF INSTEAD OF FIRST FOR THE GOOD
DEEDS SAKE NO MAN WOULD EVER DO ONE

OM HAVE YOU COMMITTED A BENEVOLENCE LATELY

YM YES THIS MORNING

OM GIVE THE PARTICULARS

YM THE CABIN OF THE OLD NEGRO WOMAN WHO USED TO NURSE ME WHEN I WAS A
CHILD AND WHO SAVED MY LIFE ONCE AT THE RISK OF HER OWN WAS BURNED
LAST NIGHT AND SHE CAME MOURNING THIS MORNING AND PLEADING FOR MONEY
TO BUILD ANOTHER ONE

OM YOU FURNISHED IT

YM CERTAINLY

OM YOU WERE GLAD YOU HAD THE MONEY

YM MONEY I HADNT I SOLD MY HORSE

OM YOU WERE GLAD YOU HAD THE HORSE

YM OF COURSE I WAS FOR IF I HADNT HAD THE HORSE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN
INCAPABLE AND MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE CAPTURED THE CHANCE TO SET OLD
SALLY UP

OM YOU WERE CORDIALLY GLAD YOU WERE NOT CAUGHT OUT AND INCAPABLE

YM OH I JUST WAS

OM NOW THEN

YM STOP WHERE YOU ARE I KNOW YOUR WHOLE CATALOG OF QUESTIONS AND I
COULD ANSWER EVERY ONE OF THEM WITHOUT YOUR WASTING THE TIME TO ASK
THEM BUT I WILL SUMMARIZE THE WHOLE THING IN A SINGLE REMARK I DID
THE CHARITY KNOWING IT WAS BECAUSE THE ACT WOULD GIVE ME A SPLENDID
PLEASURE AND BECAUSE OLD SALLYS MOVING GRATITUDE AND DELIGHT WOULD
GIVE ME ANOTHER ONE AND BECAUSE THE REFLECTION THAT SHE WOULD BE
HAPPY NOW AND OUT OF HER TROUBLE WOULD FILL ME FULL OF HAPPINESS I
DID THE WHOLE THING WITH MY EYES OPEN AND RECOGNIZING AND REALIZING
THAT I WAS LOOKING OUT FOR MY SHARE OF THE PROFITS FIRST NOW THEN
I HAVE CONFESSED GO ON

OM I HAVENT ANYTHING TO OFFER YOU HAVE COVERED THE WHOLE GROUND
CAN YOU HAVE BEEN ANY MORE STRONGLY MOVED TO HELP SALLY OUT OF HER
TROUBLECOULD YOU HAVE DONE THE DEED ANY MORE EAGERLYIF YOU HAD BEEN
UNDER THE DELUSION THAT YOU WERE DOING IT FOR HER SAKE AND PROFIT
ONLY

YM NO NOTHING IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE MADE THE IMPULSE WHICH MOVED
ME MORE POWERFUL MORE MASTERFUL MORE THOROUGHLY IRRESISTIBLE I
PLAYED THE LIMIT

OM VERY WELL YOU BEGIN TO SUSPECTAND I CLAIM TO KNOW THAT WHEN A
MAN IS A SHADE MORE STRONGLY MOVED TO DO ONE OF TWO THINGS OR OF
TWO DOZEN THINGS THAN HE IS TO DO ANY ONE OF THE OTHERS HE WILL
INFALLIBLY DO THAT ONE THING BE IT GOOD OR BE IT EVIL AND IF IT BE
GOOD NOT ALL THE BEGUILEMENTS OF ALL THE CASUISTRIES CAN INCREASE THE
STRENGTH OF THE IMPULSE BY A SINGLE SHADE OR ADD A SHADE TO THE COMFORT
AND CONTENTMENT HE WILL GET OUT OF THE ACT

YM THEN YOU BELIEVE THAT SUCH TENDENCY TOWARD DOING GOOD AS IS IN
MENS HEARTS WOULD NOT BE DIMINISHED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE DELUSION
THAT GOOD DEEDS ARE DONE PRIMARILY FOR THE SAKE OF NO INSTEAD OF FOR
THE SAKE OF NO

OM THAT IS WHAT I FULLY BELIEVE

YM DOESNT IT SOMEHOW SEEM TO TAKE FROM THE DIGNITY OF THE DEED

OM IF THERE IS DIGNITY IN FALSITY IT DOES IT REMOVES THAT

YM WHAT IS LEFT FOR THE MORALISTS TO DO

OM TEACH UNRESERVEDLY WHAT HE ALREADY TEACHES WITH ONE SIDE OF HIS
MOUTH AND TAKES BACK WITH THE OTHER DO RIGHT FOR YOUR OWN SAKE AND
BE HAPPY IN KNOWING THAT YOUR NEIGHBOR WILL CERTAINLY SHARE IN THE
BENEFITS RESULTING

YM REPEAT YOUR ADMONITION

OM DILIGENTLY TRAIN YOUR IDEALS UPWARD AND STILL UPWARD TOWARD A
SUMMIT WHERE YOU WILL FIND YOUR CHIEFEST PLEASURE IN CONDUCT WHICH
WHILE CONTENTING YOU WILL BE SURE TO CONFER BENEFITS UPON YOUR
NEIGHBOR AND THE COMMUNITY

YM ONES EVERY ACT PROCEEDS FROM EXTERIOR INFLUENCES YOU THINK

OM YES

YM IF I CONCLUDE TO ROB A PERSON I AM NOT THE ORIGINATOR OF THE
IDEA BUT IT COMES IN FROM THE OUTSIDE I SEE HIM HANDLING MONEYFOR
INSTANCEAND THAT MOVES ME TO THE CRIME

OM THAT BY ITSELF OH CERTAINLY NOT IT IS MERELY THE LATEST
OUTSIDE INFLUENCE OF A PROCESSION OF PREPARATORY INFLUENCES STRETCHING
BACK OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS NO SINGLE OUTSIDE INFLUENCE CAN MAKE A
MAN DO A THING WHICH IS AT WAR WITH HIS TRAINING THE MOST IT CAN DO IS
TO START HIS MIND ON A NEW TRACT AND OPEN IT TO THE RECEPTION OF NEW
INFLUENCESAS IN THE CASE OF IGNATIUS LOYOLA IN TIME THESE INFLUENCES
CAN TRAIN HIM TO A POINT WHERE IT WILL BE CONSONANT WITH HIS NEW
CHARACTER TO YIELD TO THE FINAL INFLUENCE AND DO THAT THING I WILL
PUT THE CASE IN A FORM WHICH WILL MAKE MY THEORY CLEAR TO YOU I THINK
HERE ARE TWO INGOTS OF VIRGIN GOLD THEY SHALL REPRESENT A COUPLE OF
CHARACTERS WHICH HAVE BEEN REFINED AND PERFECTED IN THE VIRTUES BY
YEARS OF DILIGENT RIGHT TRAINING SUPPOSE YOU WANTED TO BREAK DOWN
THESE STRONG AND WELLCOMPACTED CHARACTERSWHAT INFLUENCE WOULD YOU
BRING TO BEAR UPON THE INGOTS

YM WORK IT OUT YOURSELF PROCEED

OM SUPPOSE I TURN UPON ONE OF THEM A STEAMJET DURING A LONG
SUCCESSION OF HOURS WILL THERE BE A RESULT

YM NONE THAT I KNOW OF

OM WHY

YM A STEAMJET CANNOT BREAK DOWN SUCH A SUBSTANCE

OM VERY WELL THE STEAM IS AN OUTSIDE INFLUENCE BUT IT IS
INEFFECTIVE BECAUSE THE GOLD TAKES NO INTEREST IN IT THE INGOT
REMAINS AS IT WAS SUPPOSE WE ADD TO THE STEAM SOME QUICKSILVER IN A
VAPORIZED CONDITION AND TURN THE JET UPON THE INGOT WILL THERE BE AN
INSTANTANEOUS RESULT

YM NO

OM THE QUICKSILVER IS AN OUTSIDE INFLUENCE WHICH GOLD BY ITS
PECULIAR NATURESAY TEMPERAMENT DISPOSITION CANNOT BE INDIFFERENT
TO IT STIRS UP THE INTEREST OF THE GOLD ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT PERCEIVE
IT BUT A SINGLE APPLICATION OF THE INFLUENCE WORKS NO DAMAGE LET US
CONTINUE THE APPLICATION IN A STEADY STREAM AND CALL EACH MINUTE A
YEAR BY THE END OF TEN OR TWENTY MINUTESTEN OR TWENTY YEARSTHE
LITTLE INGOT IS SODDEN WITH QUICKSILVER ITS VIRTUES ARE GONE ITS
CHARACTER IS DEGRADED AT LAST IT IS READY TO YIELD TO A TEMPTATION
WHICH IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN NO NOTICE OF TEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO WE
WILL APPLY THAT TEMPTATION IN THE FORM OF A PRESSURE OF MY FINGER YOU
NOTE THE RESULT

YM YES THE INGOT HAS CRUMBLED TO SAND I UNDERSTAND NOW IT IS NOT
THE SINGLE OUTSIDE INFLUENCE THAT DOES THE WORK BUT ONLY THE LAST
ONE OF A LONG AND DISINTEGRATING ACCUMULATION OF THEM I SEE NOW HOW
MY SINGLE IMPULSE TO ROB THE MAN IS NOT THE ONE THAT MAKES ME DO IT
BUT ONLY THE LAST ONE OF A PREPARATORY SERIES YOU MIGHT ILLUSTRATE
WITH A PARABLE

A PARABLE

OM I WILL THERE WAS ONCE A PAIR OF NEW ENGLAND BOYSTWINS THEY WERE
ALIKE IN GOOD DISPOSITIONS FECKLESS MORALS AND PERSONAL APPEARANCE
THEY WERE THE MODELS OF THE SUNDAYSCHOOL AT FIFTEEN GEORGE HAD THE
OPPORTUNITY TO GO AS CABINBOY IN A WHALESHIP AND SAILED AWAY FOR THE
PACIFIC HENRY REMAINED AT HOME IN THE VILLAGE AT EIGHTEEN GEORGE WAS
A SAILOR BEFORE THE MAST AND HENRY WAS TEACHER OF THE ADVANCED BIBLE
CLASS AT TWENTYTWO GEORGE THROUGH FIGHTINGHABITS AND
DRINKINGHABITS ACQUIRED AT SEA AND IN THE SAILOR BOARDINGHOUSES OF
THE EUROPEAN AND ORIENTAL PORTS WAS A COMMON ROUGH IN HONGKONG AND
OUT OF A JOB AND HENRY WAS SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SUNDAYSCHOOL AT
TWENTYSIX GEORGE WAS A WANDERER A TRAMP AND HENRY WAS PASTOR OF THE
VILLAGE CHURCH THEN GEORGE CAME HOME AND WAS HENRYS GUEST ONE
EVENING A MAN PASSED BY AND TURNED DOWN THE LANE AND HENRY SAID WITH
A PATHETIC SMILE WITHOUT INTENDING ME A DISCOMFORT THAT MAN IS
ALWAYS KEEPING ME REMINDED OF MY PINCHING POVERTY FOR HE CARRIES HEAPS
OF MONEY ABOUT HIM AND GOES BY HERE EVERY EVENING OF HIS LIFE THAT
OUTSIDE INFLUENCE THAT REMARKWAS ENOUGH FOR GEORGE BUT IT WAS
NOT THE ONE THAT MADE HIM AMBUSH THE MAN AND ROB HIM IT MERELY
REPRESENTED THE ELEVEN YEARS ACCUMULATION OF SUCH INFLUENCES AND GAVE
BIRTH TO THE ACT FOR WHICH THEIR LONG GESTATION HAD MADE PREPARATION
IT HAD NEVER ENTERED THE HEAD OF HENRY TO ROB THE MANHIS INGOT HAD
BEEN SUBJECTED TO CLEAN STEAM ONLY BUT GEORGES HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO
VAPORIZED QUICKSILVER

COLLEGES AND MUSEUMS WHILE ONE HUMAN BEING IS DESTITUTE OF BREAD SHE
HAS ANSWERED HER QUESTION HERSELF HER FEELING FOR THE POOR SHOWS THAT
SHE HAS A STANDARD OF BENEVOLENCE THERE SHE HAS CONCEDED THE

HERSELF TO ADOPT HIS THE HUMAN BEING ALWAYS LOOKS DOWN WHEN HE IS
EXAMINING ANOTHER PERSONS STANDARD HE NEVER FIND ONE THAT HE HAS TO
EXAMINE BY LOOKING UP

THE MANMACHINE AGAIN

YOUNG MAN YOU REALLY THINK MAN IS A MERE MACHINE

OLD MAN I DO

YM AND THAT HIS MIND WORKS AUTOMATICALLY AND IS INDEPENDENT OF HIS
CONTROLCARRIES ON THOUGHT ON ITS OWN HOOK

OM YES IT IS DILIGENTLY AT WORK UNCEASINGLY AT WORK DURING EVERY
WAKING MOMENT HAVE YOU NEVER TOSSED ABOUT ALL NIGHT IMPLORING
BESEECHING COMMANDING YOUR MIND TO STOP WORK AND LET YOU GO TO
SLEEPYOU WHO PERHAPS IMAGINE THAT YOUR MIND IS YOUR SERVANT AND MUST
OBEY YOUR ORDERS THINK WHAT YOU TELL IT TO THINK AND STOP WHEN YOU
TELL IT TO STOP WHEN IT CHOOSES TO WORK THERE IS NO WAY TO KEEP IT
STILL FOR AN INSTANT THE BRIGHTEST MAN WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPLY IT
WITH SUBJECTS IF HE HAD TO HUNT THEM UP IF IT NEEDED THE MANS HELP IT
WOULD WAIT FOR HIM TO GIVE IT WORK WHEN HE WAKES IN THE MORNING

YM MAYBE IT DOES

OM NO IT BEGINS RIGHT AWAY BEFORE THE MAN GETS WIDE ENOUGH AWAKE TO
GIVE IT A SUGGESTION HE MAY GO TO SLEEP SAYING THE MOMENT I WAKE I
WILL THINK UPON SUCH AND SUCH A SUBJECT BUT HE WILL FAIL HIS MIND
WILL BE TOO QUICK FOR HIM BY THE TIME HE HAS BECOME NEARLY ENOUGH
AWAKE TO BE HALF CONSCIOUS HE WILL FIND THAT IT IS ALREADY AT WORK
UPON ANOTHER SUBJECT MAKE THE EXPERIMENT AND SEE

YM AT ANY RATE HE CAN MAKE IT STICK TO A SUBJECT IF HE WANTS TO

OM NOT IF IT FIND ANOTHER THAT SUITS IT BETTER AS A RULE IT WILL
LISTEN TO NEITHER A DULL SPEAKER NOR A BRIGHT ONE IT REFUSES ALL
PERSUASION THE DULL SPEAKER WEARIES IT AND SENDS IT FAR AWAY IN IDLE
DREAMS THE BRIGHT SPEAKER THROWS OUT STIMULATING IDEAS WHICH IT GOES
CHASING AFTER AND IS AT ONCE UNCONSCIOUS OF HIM AND HIS TALK YOU
CANNOT KEEP YOUR MIND FROM WANDERING IF IT WANTS TO IT IS MASTER NOT
YOU

AFTER AN INTERVAL OF DAYS

OM NOW DREAMSBUT WE WILL EXAMINE THAT LATER MEANTIME DID YOU TRY
COMMANDING YOUR MIND TO WAIT FOR ORDERS FROM YOU AND NOT DO ANY
THINKING ON ITS OWN HOOK

YM YES I COMMANDED IT TO STAND READY TO TAKE ORDERS WHEN I SHOULD
WAKE IN THE MORNING

OM DID IT OBEY

YM NO IT WENT TO THINKING OF SOMETHING OF ITS OWN INITIATION
WITHOUT WAITING FOR ME ALSOAS YOU SUGGESTEDAT NIGHT I APPOINTED A
THEME FOR IT TO BEGIN ON IN THE MORNING AND COMMANDED IT TO BEGIN ON
THAT ONE AND NO OTHER

OM DID IT OBEY

YM NO

OM HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU TRY THE EXPERIMENT

YM TEN

OM HOW MANY SUCCESSES DID YOU SCORE

YM NOT ONE

OM IT IS AS I HAVE SAID THE MIND IS INDEPENDENT OF THE MAN HE HAS
NO CONTROL OVER IT IT DOES AS IT PLEASES IT WILL TAKE UP A SUBJECT IN
SPITE OF HIM IT WILL STICK TO IT IN SPITE OF HIM IT WILL THROW IT
ASIDE IN SPITE OF HIM IT IS ENTIRELY INDEPENDENT OF HIM

YM GO ON ILLUSTRATE

OM DO YOU KNOW CHESS

YM I LEARNED IT A WEEK AGO

OM DID YOUR MIND GO ON PLAYING THE GAME ALL NIGHT THAT FIRST NIGHT

YM DONT MENTION IT

OM IT WAS EAGERLY UNSATISFIABLY INTERESTED IT RIOTED IN THE
COMBINATIONS YOU IMPLORED IT TO DROP THE GAME AND LET YOU GET SOME
SLEEP

YM YES IT WOULDNT LISTEN IT PLAYED RIGHT ALONG IT WORE ME OUT AND
I GOT UP HAGGARD AND WRETCHED IN THE MORNING

OM AT SOME TIME OR OTHER YOU HAVE BEEN CAPTIVATED BY A RIDICULOUS
RHYMEJINGLE

YM INDEED YES

I SAW ESAU KISSING KATE
AND SHE SAW I SAW ESAU
I SAW ESAU HE SAW KATE

AND SO ON MY MIND WENT MAD WITH JOY OVER IT IT REPEATED IT ALL DAY
AND ALL NIGHT FOR A WEEK IN SPITE OF ALL I COULD DO TO STOP IT AND IT
SEEMED TO ME THAT I MUST SURELY GO CRAZY

OM AND THE NEW POPULAR SONG

YM OH YES IN THE SWEEEET BY AND BY ETC YES THE NEW POPULAR
SONG WITH THE TAKING MELODY SINGS THROUGH ONES HEAD DAY AND NIGHT
ASLEEP AND AWAKE TILL ONE IS A WRECK THERE IS NO GETTING THE MIND TO
LET IT ALONE

OM YES ASLEEP AS WELL AS AWAKE THE MIND IS QUITE INDEPENDENT IT IS
MASTER YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT IT IS SO APART FROM YOU THAT IT
CAN CONDUCT ITS AFFAIRS SING ITS SONGS PLAY ITS CHESS WEAVE ITS
COMPLEX AND INGENIOUSLY CONSTRUCTED DREAMS WHILE YOU SLEEP IT HAS NO
USE FOR YOUR HELP NO USE FOR YOUR GUIDANCE AND NEVER USES EITHER
WHETHER YOU BE ASLEEP OR AWAKE YOU HAVE IMAGINED THAT YOU COULD
ORIGINATE A THOUGHT IN YOUR MIND AND YOU HAVE SINCERELY BELIEVED YOU
COULD DO IT

YM YES I HAVE HAD THAT IDEA

OM YET YOU CANT ORIGINATE A DREAMTHOUGHT FOR IT TO WORK OUT AND
GET IT ACCEPTED

YM NO

OM AND YOU CANT DICTATE ITS PROCEDURE AFTER IT HAS ORIGINATED A
DREAMTHOUGHT FOR ITSELF

YM NO NO ONE CAN DO IT DO YOU THINK THE WAKING MIND AND THE DREAM
MIND ARE THE SAME MACHINE

OM THERE IS ARGUMENT FOR IT WE HAVE WILD AND FANTASTIC DAYTHOUGHTS
THINGS THAT ARE DREAMLIKE

YM YESLIKE MR WELLSS MAN WHO INVENTED A DRUG THAT MADE HIM
INVISIBLE AND LIKE THE ARABIAN TALES OF THE THOUSAND NIGHTS

OM AND THERE ARE DREAMS THAT ARE RATIONAL SIMPLE CONSISTENT AND
UNFANTASTIC

YM YES I HAVE DREAMS THAT ARE LIKE THAT DREAMS THAT ARE JUST LIKE
REAL LIFE DREAMS IN WHICH THERE ARE SEVERAL PERSONS WITH DISTINCTLY
DIFFERENTIATED CHARACTERSINVENTIONS OF MY MIND AND YET STRANGERS TO
ME A VULGAR PERSON A REFINED ONE A WISE PERSON A FOOL A CRUEL
PERSON A KIND AND COMPASSIONATE ONE A QUARRELSOME PERSON A
PEACEMAKER OLD PERSONS AND YOUNG BEAUTIFUL GIRLS AND HOMELY ONES

ARTISTICALLY DEVELOPS IT AND CARRIES THE LITTLE DRAMA CREDITABLY
THROUGHALL WITHOUT HELP OR SUGGESTION FROM YOU

YM YES

OM IT IS ARGUMENT THAT IT COULD DO THE LIKE AWAKE WITHOUT HELP OR
SUGGESTION FROM YOUAND I THINK IT DOES IT IS ARGUMENT THAT IT IS THE
SAME OLD MIND IN BOTH CASES AND NEVER NEEDS YOUR HELP I THINK THE
MIND IS PURELY A MACHINE A THOROUGHLY INDEPENDENT MACHINE AN
AUTOMATIC MACHINE HAVE YOU TRIED THE OTHER EXPERIMENT WHICH I
SUGGESTED TO YOU

YM WHICH ONE

OM THE ONE WHICH WAS TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH INFLUENCE YOU HAVE OVER
YOUR MINDIF ANY

YM YES AND GOT MORE OR LESS ENTERTAINMENT OUT OF IT I DID AS YOU
ORDERED I PLACED TWO TEXTS BEFORE MY EYESONE A DULL ONE AND BARREN OF
INTEREST THE OTHER ONE FULL OF INTEREST INFLAMED WITH IT WHITEHOT
WITH IT I COMMANDED MY MIND TO BUSY ITSELF SOLELY WITH THE DULL ONE

OM DID IT OBEY

YM WELL NO IT DIDNT IT BUSIED ITSELF WITH THE OTHER ONE

OM DID YOU TRY HARD TO MAKE IT OBEY

YM YES I DID MY HONEST BEST

OM WHAT WAS THE TEXT WHICH IT REFUSED TO BE INTERESTED IN OR THINK
ABOUT

YM IT WAS THIS QUESTION IF A OWES B A DOLLAR AND A HALF AND B OWES
C TWO AND THREEQUARTER AND C OWES A THIRTYFIVE CENTS AND D AND A
TOGETHER OWE E AND B THREESIXTEENTHS OFOFI DONT REMEMBER THE REST
NOW BUT ANYWAY IT WAS WHOLLY UNINTERESTING AND I COULD NOT FORCE MY
MIND TO STICK TO IT EVEN HALF A MINUTE AT A TIME IT KEPT FLYING OFF TO
THE OTHER TEXT

OM WHAT WAS THE OTHER TEXT

YM IT IS NO MATTER ABOUT THAT

OM BUT WHAT WAS IT

YM A PHOTOGRAPH

OM YOUR OWN

YM NO IT WAS HERS

OM YOU REALLY MADE AN HONEST GOOD TEST DID YOU MAKE A SECOND TRIAL

YM YES I COMMANDED MY MIND TO INTEREST ITSELF IN THE MORNING PAPERS
REPORT OF THE PORKMARKET AND AT THE SAME TIME I REMINDED IT OF AN
EXPERIENCE OF MINE OF SIXTEEN YEARS AGO IT REFUSED TO CONSIDER THE
PORK AND GAVE ITS WHOLE BLAZING INTEREST TO THAT ANCIENT INCIDENT

OM WHAT WAS THE INCIDENT

YM AN ARMED DESPERADO SLAPPED MY FACE IN THE PRESENCE OF TWENTY
SPECTATORS IT MAKES ME WILD AND MURDEROUS EVERY TIME I THINK OF IT

OM GOOD TESTS BOTH VERY GOOD TESTS DID YOU TRY MY OTHER
SUGGESTION

YM THE ONE WHICH WAS TO PROVE TO ME THAT IF I WOULD LEAVE MY MIND TO
ITS OWN DEVICES IT WOULD FIND THINGS TO THINK ABOUT WITHOUT ANY OF MY
HELP AND THUS CONVINCE ME THAT IT WAS A MACHINE AN AUTOMATIC MACHINE
SET IN MOTION BY EXTERIOR INFLUENCES AND AS INDEPENDENT OF ME AS IT
COULD BE IF IT WERE IN SOME ONE ELSES SKULL IS THAT THE ONE

OM YES

YM I TRIED IT I WAS SHAVING I HAD SLEPT WELL AND MY MIND WAS VERY
LIVELY EVEN GAY AND FRISKY IT WAS REVELING IN A FANTASTIC AND JOYFUL
EPISODE OF MY REMOTE BOYHOOD WHICH HAD SUDDENLY FLASHED UP IN MY
MEMORYMOVED TO THIS BY THE SPECTACLE OF A YELLOW CAT PICKING ITS WAY
CAREFULLY ALONG THE TOP OF THE GARDEN WALL THE COLOR OF THIS CAT
BROUGHT THE BYGONE CAT BEFORE ME AND I SAW HER WALKING ALONG THE
SIDESTEP OF THE PULPIT SAW HER WALK ON TO A LARGE SHEET OF STICKY
FLYPAPER AND GET ALL HER FEET INVOLVED SAW HER STRUGGLE AND FALL
DOWN HELPLESS AND DISSATISFIED MORE AND MORE URGENT MORE AND MORE
UNRECONCILED MORE AND MORE MUTELY PROFANE SAW THE SILENT CONGREGATION
QUIVERING LIKE JELLY AND THE TEARS RUNNING DOWN THEIR FACES I SAW IT
ALL THE SIGHT OF THE TEARS WHISKED MY MIND TO A FAR DISTANT AND A
SADDER SCENEIN TERRA DEL FUEGOAND WITH DARWINS EYES I SAW A NAKED
GREAT SAVAGE HURL HIS LITTLE BOY AGAINST THE ROCKS FOR A TRIFLING
FAULT SAW THE POOR MOTHER GATHER UP HER DYING CHILD AND HUG IT TO HER
BREAST AND WEEP UTTERING NO WORD DID MY MIND STOP TO MOURN WITH THAT
NUDE BLACK SISTER OF MINE NOIT WAS FAR AWAY FROM THAT SCENE IN AN
INSTANT AND WAS BUSYING ITSELF WITH AN EVERRECURRING AND DISAGREEABLE
DREAM OF MINE IN THIS DREAM I ALWAYS FIND MYSELF STRIPPED TO MY
SHIRT CRINGING AND DODGING ABOUT IN THE MIDST OF A GREAT DRAWINGROOM
THRONG OF FINELY DRESSED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND WONDERING HOW I GOT
THERE AND SO ON AND SO ON PICTURE AFTER PICTURE INCIDENT AFTER
INCIDENT A DRIFTING PANORAMA OF EVERCHANGING EVERDISSOLVING VIEWS
MANUFACTURED BY MY MIND WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM MEWHY IT WOULD TAKE ME
TWO HOURS TO MERELY NAME THE MULTITUDE OF THINGS MY MIND TALLIED OFF
AND PHOTOGRAPHED IN FIFTEEN MINUTES LET ALONE DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU

OM A MANS MIND LEFT FREE HAS NO USE FOR HIS HELP BUT THERE IS ONE
WAY WHEREBY HE CAN GET ITS HELP WHEN HE DESIRES IT

YM WHAT IS THAT WAY

OM WHEN YOUR MIND IS RACING ALONG FROM SUBJECT TO SUBJECT AND STRIKES
AN INSPIRING ONE OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND BEGIN TALKING UPON THAT
MATTERORTAKE YOUR PEN AND USE THAT IT WILL INTEREST YOUR MIND AND
CONCENTRATE IT AND IT WILL PURSUE THE SUBJECT WITH SATISFACTION IT
WILL TAKE FULL CHARGE AND FURNISH THE WORDS ITSELF

YM BUT DONT I TELL IT WHAT TO SAY

OM THERE ARE CERTAINLY OCCASIONS WHEN YOU HAVENT TIME THE WORDS
LEAP OUT BEFORE YOU KNOW WHAT IS COMING

YM FOR INSTANCE

OM WELL TAKE A FLASH OF WITREPARTEE FLASH IS THE RIGHT WORD IT
IS OUT INSTANTLY THERE IS NO TIME TO ARRANGE THE WORDS THERE IS NO
THINKING NO REFLECTING WHERE THERE IS A WITMECHANISM IT IS AUTOMATIC
IN ITS ACTION AND NEEDS NO HELP WHERE THE WITMECHANISM IS LACKING NO
AMOUNT OF STUDY AND REFLECTION CAN MANUFACTURE THE PRODUCT

YM YOU REALLY THINK A MAN ORIGINATES NOTHING CREATES NOTHING

THE THINKINGPROCESS

OM I DO MEN PERCEIVE AND THEIR BRAINMACHINES AUTOMATICALLY COMBINE
THE THINGS PERCEIVED THAT IS ALL

YM THE STEAMENGINE

OM IT TAKES FIFTY MEN A HUNDRED YEARS TO INVENT IT ONE MEANING OF
INVENT IS DISCOVER I USE THE WORD IN THAT SENSE LITTLE BY LITTLE THEY
DISCOVER AND APPLY THE MULTITUDE OF DETAILS THAT GO TO MAKE THE PERFECT
ENGINE WATT NOTICED THAT CONFINED STEAM WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO LIFT THE
LID OF THE TEAPOT HE DIDNT CREATE THE IDEA HE MERELY DISCOVERED THE
FACT THE CAT HAD NOTICED IT A HUNDRED TIMES FROM THE TEAPOT HE
EVOLVED THE CYLINDERFROM THE DISPLACED LID HE EVOLVED THE PISTONROD
TO ATTACH SOMETHING TO THE PISTONROD TO BE MOVED BY IT WAS A SIMPLE
MATTERCRANK AND WHEEL AND SO THERE WAS A WORKING ENGINE

ONE BY ONE IMPROVEMENTS WERE DISCOVERED BY MEN WHO USED THEIR EYES
NOT THEIR CREATING POWERSFOR THEY HADNT ANYAND NOW AFTER A HUNDRED
YEARS THE PATIENT CONTRIBUTIONS OF FIFTY OR A HUNDRED OBSERVERS STAND
COMPACTED IN THE WONDERFUL MACHINE WHICH DRIVES THE OCEAN LINER

YM A SHAKESPEAREAN PLAY

OM THE PROCESS IS THE SAME THE FIRST ACTOR WAS A SAVAGE HE
REPRODUCED IN HIS THEATRICAL WARDANCES SCALPDANCES AND SO ON
INCIDENTS WHICH HE HAD SEEN IN REAL LIFE A MORE ADVANCED CIVILIZATION
PRODUCED MORE INCIDENTS MORE EPISODES THE ACTOR AND THE STORYTELLER
BORROWED THEM AND SO THE DRAMA GREW LITTLE BY LITTLE STAGE BY STAGE
IT IS MADE UP OF THE FACTS OF LIFE NOT CREATIONS IT TOOK CENTURIES TO
DEVELOP THE GREEK DRAMA IT BORROWED FROM PRECEDING AGES IT LENT TO
THE AGES THAT CAME AFTER MEN OBSERVE AND COMBINE THAT IS ALL SO DOES
A RAT

YM HOW

OM HE OBSERVES A SMELL HE INFERS A CHEESE HE SEEKS AND FINDS THE
ASTRONOMER OBSERVES THIS AND THAT ADDS HIS THIS AND THAT TO THE
THISANDTHATS OF A HUNDRED PREDECESSORS INFERS AN INVISIBLE PLANET
SEEKS IT AND FINDS IT THE RAT GETS INTO A TRAP GETS OUT WITH TROUBLE
INFERS THAT CHEESE IN TRAPS LACKS VALUE AND MEDDLES WITH THAT TRAP NO
MORE THE ASTRONOMER IS VERY PROUD OF HIS ACHIEVEMENT THE RAT IS PROUD
OF HIS YET BOTH ARE MACHINES THEY HAVE DONE MACHINE WORK THEY HAVE
ORIGINATED NOTHING THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE VAIN THE WHOLE CREDIT
BELONGS TO THEIR MAKER THEY ARE ENTITLED TO NO HONORS NO PRAISES NO
MONUMENTS WHEN THEY DIE NO REMEMBRANCE ONE IS A COMPLEX AND ELABORATE
MACHINE THE OTHER A SIMPLE AND LIMITED MACHINE BUT THEY ARE ALIKE IN
PRINCIPLE FUNCTION AND PROCESS AND NEITHER OF THEM WORKS OTHERWISE
THAN AUTOMATICALLY AND NEITHER OF THEM MAY RIGHTEOUSLY CLAIM A
PERSONAL SUPERIORITY OR A PERSONAL DIGNITY ABOVE THE OTHER

YM IN EARNED PERSONAL DIGNITY THEN AND IN PERSONAL MERIT FOR WHAT
HE DOES IT FOLLOWS OF NECESSITY THAT HE IS ON THE SAME LEVEL AS A RAT

OM HIS BROTHER THE RAT YES THAT IS HOW IT SEEMS TO ME NEITHER OF
THEM BEING ENTITLED TO ANY PERSONAL MERIT FOR WHAT HE DOES IT FOLLOWS
OF NECESSITY THAT NEITHER OF THEM HAS A RIGHT TO ARROGATE TO HIMSELF
PERSONALLY CREATED SUPERIORITIES OVER HIS BROTHER

YM ARE YOU DETERMINED TO GO ON BELIEVING IN THESE INSANITIES WOULD
YOU GO ON BELIEVING IN THEM IN THE FACE OF ABLE ARGUMENTS BACKED BY
COLLATED FACTS AND INSTANCES

OM I HAVE BEEN A HUMBLE EARNEST AND SINCERE TRUTHSEEKER

YM VERY WELL

OM THE HUMBLE EARNEST AND SINCERE TRUTHSEEKER IS ALWAYS
CONVERTIBLE BY SUCH MEANS

YM I AM THANKFUL TO GOD TO HEAR YOU SAY THIS FOR NOW I KNOW THAT
YOUR CONVERSION

OM WAIT YOU MISUNDERSTAND I SAID I HAVE BEEN A TRUTHSEEKER

YM WELL

OM I AM NOT THAT NOW HAVE YOUR FORGOTTEN I TOLD YOU THAT THERE ARE
NONE BUT TEMPORARY TRUTHSEEKERS THAT A PERMANENT ONE IS A HUMAN
IMPOSSIBILITY THAT AS SOON AS THE SEEKER FINDS WHAT HE IS THOROUGHLY
CONVINCED IS THE TRUTH HE SEEKS NO FURTHER BUT GIVES THE REST OF HIS
DAYS TO HUNTING JUNK TO PATCH IT AND CAULK IT AND PROP IT WITH AND
MAKE IT WEATHERPROOF AND KEEP IT FROM CAVING IN ON HIM HENCE THE
PRESBYTERIAN REMAINS A PRESBYTERIAN THE MOHAMMEDAN A MOHAMMEDAN THE
SPIRITUALIST A SPIRITUALIST THE DEMOCRAT A DEMOCRAT THE REPUBLICAN A
REPUBLICAN THE MONARCHIST A MONARCHIST AND IF A HUMBLE EARNEST AND
SINCERE SEEKER AFTER TRUTH SHOULD FIND IT IN THE PROPOSITION THAT THE
MOON IS MADE OF GREEN CHEESE NOTHING COULD EVER BUDGE HIM FROM THAT
POSITION FOR HE IS NOTHING BUT AN AUTOMATIC MACHINE AND MUST OBEY THE
LAWS OF HIS CONSTRUCTION

YM AND SO

OM HAVING FOUND THE TRUTH PERCEIVING THAT BEYOND QUESTION MAN HAS
BUT ONE MOVING IMPULSETHE CONTENTING OF HIS OWN SPIRITAND IS MERELY A
MACHINE AND ENTITLED TO NO PERSONAL MERIT FOR ANYTHING HE DOES IT IS
NOT HUMANLY POSSIBLE FOR ME TO SEEK FURTHER THE REST OF MY DAYS WILL
BE SPENT IN PATCHING AND PAINTING AND PUTTYING AND CAULKING MY
PRICELESS POSSESSION AND IN LOOKING THE OTHER WAY WHEN AN IMPLORING
ARGUMENT OR A DAMAGING FACT APPROACHES

THE MARQUESS OF WORCESTER HAD DONE ALL OF THIS MORE THAN A CENTURY
EARLIER

VI

INSTINCT AND THOUGHT

YOUNG MAN IT IS ODIOUS THOSE DRUNKEN THEORIES OF YOURS ADVANCED A
WHILE AGOCONCERNING THE RAT AND ALL THATSTRIP MAN BARE OF ALL HIS
DIGNITIES GRANDEURS SUBLIMITIES

OLD MAN HE HASNT ANY TO STRIPTHEY ARE SHAMS STOLEN CLOTHES HE
CLAIMS CREDITS WHICH BELONG SOLELY TO HIS MAKER

YM BUT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO PUT HIM ON A LEVEL WITH A RAT

OM I DONTMORALLY THAT WOULD NOT BE FAIR TO THE RAT THE RAT IS
WELL ABOVE HIM THERE

YM ARE YOU JOKING

OM NO I AM NOT

YM THEN WHAT DO YOU MEAN

OM THAT COMES UNDER THE HEAD OF THE MORAL SENSE IT IS A LARGE
QUESTION LET US FINISH WITH WHAT WE ARE ABOUT NOW BEFORE WE TAKE IT
UP

YM VERY WELL YOU HAVE SEEMED TO CONCEDE THAT YOU PLACE MAN AND THE
RAT ON A LEVEL WHAT IS IT THE INTELLECTUAL

OM IN FORMNOT A DEGREE

YM EXPLAIN

OM I THINK THAT THE RATS MIND AND THE MANS MIND ARE THE SAME
MACHINE BUT OF UNEQUAL CAPACITIESLIKE YOURS AND EDISONS LIKE THE
AFRICAN PYGMYS AND HOMERS LIKE THE BUSHMANS AND BISMARCKS

YM HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE THAT OUT WHEN THE LOWER ANIMALS HAVE NO
MENTAL QUALITY BUT INSTINCT WHILE MAN POSSESSES REASON

OM WHAT IS INSTINCT

YM IT IS MERELY UNTHINKING AND MECHANICAL EXERCISE OF INHERITED
HABIT

OM WHAT ORIGINATED THE HABIT

YM THE FIRST ANIMAL STARTED IT ITS DESCENDANTS HAVE INHERITED IT

OM HOW DID THE FIRST ONE COME TO START IT

YM I DONT KNOW BUT IT DIDNT THINK IT OUT

OM HOW DO YOU KNOW IT DIDNT

YM WELLI HAVE A RIGHT TO SUPPOSE IT DIDNT ANYWAY

OM I DONT BELIEVE YOU HAVE WHAT IS THOUGHT

YM I KNOW WHAT YOU CALL IT THE MECHANICAL AND AUTOMATIC PUTTING
TOGETHER OF IMPRESSIONS RECEIVED FROM OUTSIDE AND DRAWING AN INFERENCE
FROM THEM

OM VERY GOOD NOW MY IDEA OF THE MEANINGLESS TERM INSTINCT IS THAT
IT IS MERELY PETRIFIED THOUGHT SOLIDIFIED AND MADE INANIMATE BY
HABIT THOUGHT WHICH WAS ONCE ALIVE AND AWAKE BUT IS BECOME
UNCONSCIOUSWALKS IN ITS SLEEP SO TO SPEAK

YM ILLUSTRATE IT

OM TAKE A HERD OF COWS FEEDING IN A PASTURE THEIR HEADS ARE ALL
TURNED IN ONE DIRECTION THEY DO THAT INSTINCTIVELY THEY GAIN NOTHING
BY IT THEY HAVE NO REASON FOR IT THEY DONT KNOW WHY THEY DO IT IT
IS AN INHERITED HABIT WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY THOUGHTTHAT IS TO SAY
OBSERVATION OF AN EXTERIOR FACT AND A VALUABLE INFERENCE DRAWN FROM
THAT OBSERVATION AND CONFIRMED BY EXPERIENCE THE ORIGINAL WILD OX
NOTICED THAT WITH THE WIND IN HIS FAVOR HE COULD SMELL HIS ENEMY IN
TIME TO ESCAPE THEN HE INFERRED THAT IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO KEEP HIS
NOSE TO THE WIND THAT IS THE PROCESS WHICH MAN CALLS REASONING MANS
THOUGHTMACHINE WORKS JUST LIKE THE OTHER ANIMALS BUT IT IS A BETTER
ONE AND MORE EDISONIAN MAN IN THE OXS PLACE WOULD GO FURTHER
REASON WIDER HE WOULD FACE PART OF THE HERD THE OTHER WAY AND PROTECT
BOTH FRONT AND REAR

YM DID YOU STAY THE TERM INSTINCT IS MEANINGLESS

OM I THINK IT IS A BASTARD WORD I THINK IT CONFUSES US FOR AS A
RULE IT APPLIES ITSELF TO HABITS AND IMPULSES WHICH HAD A FAROFF
ORIGIN IN THOUGHT AND NOW AND THEN BREAKS THE RULE AND APPLIES ITSELF
TO HABITS WHICH CAN HARDLY CLAIM A THOUGHTORIGIN

YM GIVE AN INSTANCE

OM WELL IN PUTTING ON TROUSERS A MAN ALWAYS INSERTS THE SAME OLD LEG
FIRSTNEVER THE OTHER ONE THERE IS NO ADVANTAGE IN THAT AND NO SENSE
IN IT ALL MEN DO IT YET NO MAN THOUGHT IT OUT AND ADOPTED IT OF SET
PURPOSE I IMAGINE BUT IT IS A HABIT WHICH IS TRANSMITTED NO DOUBT
AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE TRANSMITTED

YM CAN YOU PROVE THAT THE HABIT EXISTS

OM YOU CAN PROVE IT IF YOU DOUBT IF YOU WILL TAKE A MAN TO A
CLOTHINGSTORE AND WATCH HIM TRY ON A DOZEN PAIRS OF TROUSERS YOU WILL
SEE

YM THE COW ILLUSTRATION IS NOT

OM SUFFICIENT TO SHOW THAT A DUMB ANIMALS MENTAL MACHINE IS JUST THE
SAME AS A MANS AND ITS REASONING PROCESSES THE SAME I WILL ILLUSTRATE
FURTHER IF YOU SHOULD HAND MR EDISON A BOX WHICH YOU CAUSED TO FLY
OPEN BY SOME CONCEALED DEVICE HE WOULD INFER A SPRING AND WOULD HUNT
FOR IT AND FIND IT NOW AN UNCLE OF MINE HAD AN OLD HORSE WHO USED TO
GET INTO THE CLOSED LOT WHERE THE CORNCRIB WAS AND DISHONESTLY TAKE
THE CORN I GOT THE PUNISHMENT MYSELF AS IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT I HAD
HEEDLESSLY FAILED TO INSERT THE WOODEN PIN WHICH KEPT THE GATE CLOSED
THESE PERSISTENT PUNISHMENTS FATIGUED ME THEY ALSO CAUSED ME TO INFER
THE EXISTENCE OF A CULPRIT SOMEWHERE SO I HID MYSELF AND WATCHED THE
GATE PRESENTLY THE HORSE CAME AND PULLED THE PIN OUT WITH HIS TEETH
AND WENT IN NOBODY TAUGHT HIM THAT HE HAD OBSERVEDTHEN THOUGHT IT
OUT FOR HIMSELF HIS PROCESS DID NOT DIFFER FROM EDISONS HE PUT THIS
AND THAT TOGETHER AND DREW AN INFERENCEAND THE PEG TOO BUT I MADE
HIM SWEAT FOR IT

YM IT HAS SOMETHING OF THE SEEMING OF THOUGHT ABOUT IT STILL IT IS
NOT VERY ELABORATE ENLARGE

OM SUPPOSE MR EDISON HAS BEEN ENJOYING SOME ONES HOSPITALITIES HE
COMES AGAIN BY AND BY AND THE HOUSE IS VACANT HE INFERS THAT HIS HOST
HAS MOVED A WHILE AFTERWARD IN ANOTHER TOWN HE SEES THE MAN ENTER A
HOUSE HE INFERS THAT THAT IS THE NEW HOME AND FOLLOWS TO INQUIRE
HERE NOW IS THE EXPERIENCE OF A GULL AS RELATED BY A NATURALIST THE
SCENE IS A SCOTCH FISHING VILLAGE WHERE THE GULLS WERE KINDLY TREATED
THIS PARTICULAR GULL VISITED A COTTAGE WAS FED CAME NEXT DAY AND WAS
FED AGAIN CAME INTO THE HOUSE NEXT TIME AND ATE WITH THE FAMILY
KEPT ON DOING THIS ALMOST DAILY THEREAFTER BUT ONCE THE GULL WAS
AWAY ON A JOURNEY FOR A FEW DAYS AND WHEN IT RETURNED THE HOUSE WAS
VACANT ITS FRIENDS HAD REMOVED TO A VILLAGE THREE MILES DISTANT
SEVERAL MONTHS LATER IT SAW THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY ON THE STREET THERE
FOLLOWED HIM HOME ENTERED THE HOUSE WITHOUT EXCUSE OR APOLOGY AND
BECAME A DAILY GUEST AGAIN GULLS DO NOT RANK HIGH MENTALLY BUT THIS
ONE HAD MEMORY AND THE REASONING FACULTY YOU SEE AND APPLIED THEM
EDISONIALLY

YM YET IT WAS NOT AN EDISON AND COULDNT BE DEVELOPED INTO ONE

OM PERHAPS NOT COULD YOU

YM THAT IS NEITHER HERE NOR THERE GO ON

OM IF EDISON WERE IN TROUBLE AND A STRANGER HELPED HIM OUT OF IT AND
NEXT DAY HE GOT INTO THE SAME DIFFICULTY AGAIN HE WOULD INFER THE WISE
THING TO DO IN CASE HE KNEW THE STRANGERS ADDRESS HERE IS A CASE OF A
BIRD AND A STRANGER AS RELATED BY A NATURALIST AN ENGLISHMAN SAW A
BIRD FLYING AROUND ABOUT HIS DOGS HEAD DOWN IN THE GROUNDS AND
UTTERING CRIES OF DISTRESS HE WENT THERE TO SEE ABOUT IT THE DOG HAD
A YOUNG BIRD IN HIS MOUTHUNHURT THE GENTLEMAN RESCUED IT AND PUT IT
ON A BUSH AND BROUGHT THE DOG AWAY EARLY THE NEXT MORNING THE MOTHER
BIRD CAME FOR THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS SITTING ON HIS VERANDA AND BY ITS
MANEUVERS PERSUADED HIM TO FOLLOW IT TO A DISTANT PART OF THE
GROUNDSFLYING A LITTLE WAY IN FRONT OF HIM AND WAITING FOR HIM TO
CATCH UP AND SO ON AND KEEPING TO THE WINDING PATH TOO INSTEAD OF
FLYING THE NEAR WAY ACROSS LOTS THE DISTANCE COVERED WAS FOUR HUNDRED
YARDS THE SAME DOG WAS THE CULPRIT HE HAD THE YOUNG BIRD AGAIN AND
ONCE MORE HE HAD TO GIVE IT UP NOW THE MOTHER BIRD HAD REASONED IT ALL
OUT SINCE THE STRANGER HAD HELPED HER ONCE SHE INFERRED THAT HE WOULD
DO IT AGAIN SHE KNEW WHERE TO FIND HIM AND SHE WENT UPON HER ERRAND
WITH CONFIDENCE HER MENTAL PROCESSES WERE WHAT EDISONS WOULD HAVE
BEEN SHE PUT THIS AND THAT TOGETHERAND THAT IS ALL THAT THOUGHT IS
AND OUT OF THEM BUILT HER LOGICAL ARRANGEMENT OF INFERENCES EDISON
COULDNT HAVE DONE IT ANY BETTER HIMSELF

YM DO YOU BELIEVE THAT MANY OF THE DUMB ANIMALS CAN THINK

OM YESTHE ELEPHANT THE MONKEY THE HORSE THE DOG THE PARROT THE
MACAW THE MOCKINGBIRD AND MANY OTHERS THE ELEPHANT WHOSE MATE FELL
INTO A PIT AND WHO DUMPED DIRT AND RUBBISH INTO THE PIT TILL BOTTOM
WAS RAISED HIGH ENOUGH TO ENABLE THE CAPTIVE TO STEP OUT WAS EQUIPPED
WITH THE REASONING QUALITY I CONCEIVE THAT ALL ANIMALS THAT CAN LEARN
THINGS THROUGH TEACHING AND DRILLING HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO OBSERVE AND
PUT THIS AND THAT TOGETHER AND DRAW AN INFERENCETHE PROCESS OF
THINKING COULD YOU TEACH AN IDIOT THE MANUAL OF ARMS AND TO ADVANCE
RETREAT AND GO THROUGH COMPLEX FIELD MANEUVERS AT THE WORD OF COMMAND

YM NOT IF HE WERE A THOROUGH IDIOT

OM WELL CANARYBIRDS CAN LEARN ALL THAT DOGS AND ELEPHANTS LEARN
ALL SORTS OF WONDERFUL THINGS THEY MUST SURELY BE ABLE TO NOTICE AND
TO PUT THINGS TOGETHER AND SAY TO THEMSELVES I GET THE IDEA NOW
WHEN I DO SO AND SO AS PER ORDER I AM PRAISED AND FED WHEN I DO
DIFFERENTLY I AM PUNISHED FLEAS CAN BE TAUGHT NEARLY ANYTHING THAT A
CONGRESSMAN CAN

YM GRANTING THEN THAT DUMB ANIMALS ARE ABLE TO THINK UPON A LOW
PLANE IS THERE ANY THAT CAN THINK UPON A HIGH ONE IS THERE ONE THAT
IS WELL UP TOWARD MAN

OM YES AS A THINKER AND PLANNER THE ANT IS THE EQUAL OF ANY SAVAGE
RACE OF MEN AS A SELFEDUCATED SPECIALIST IN SEVERAL ARTS SHE IS THE
SUPERIOR OF ANY SAVAGE RACE OF MEN AND IN ONE OR TWO HIGH MENTAL
QUALITIES SHE IS ABOVE THE REACH OF ANY MAN SAVAGE OR CIVILIZED

YM OH COME YOU ARE ABOLISHING THE INTELLECTUAL FRONTIER WHICH
SEPARATES MAN AND BEAST

OM I BEG YOUR PARDON ONE CANNOT ABOLISH WHAT DOES NOT EXIST

YM YOU ARE NOT IN EARNEST I HOPE YOU CANNOT MEAN TO SERIOUSLY SAY
THERE IS NO SUCH FRONTIER

OM I DO SAY IT SERIOUSLY THE INSTANCES OF THE HORSE THE GULL THE
MOTHER BIRD AND THE ELEPHANT SHOW THAT THOSE CREATURES PUT THEIR
THISS AND THATS TOGETHER JUST AS EDISON WOULD HAVE DONE IT AND DREW
THE SAME INFERENCES THAT HE WOULD HAVE DRAWN THEIR MENTAL MACHINERY
WAS JUST LIKE HIS ALSO ITS MANNER OF WORKING THEIR EQUIPMENT WAS AS
INFERIOR TO THE STRASBURG CLOCK BUT THAT IS THE ONLY DIFFERENCETHERE
IS NO FRONTIER

YM IT LOOKS EXASPERATINGLY TRUE AND IS DISTINCTLY OFFENSIVE IT
ELEVATES THE DUMB BEASTS TOTO

OM LET US DROP THAT LYING PHRASE AND CALL THEM THE UNREVEALED
CREATURES SO FAR AS WE CAN KNOW THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A DUMB
BEAST

YM ON WHAT GROUNDS DO YOU MAKE THAT ASSERTION

OM ON QUITE SIMPLE ONES DUMB BEAST SUGGESTS AN ANIMAL THAT HAS NO
THOUGHTMACHINERY NO UNDERSTANDING NO SPEECH NO WAY OF COMMUNICATING
WHAT IS IN ITS MIND WE KNOW THAT A HEN HAS SPEECH WE CANNOT
UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING SHE SAYS BUT WE EASILY LEARN TWO OR THREE OF HER
PHRASES WE KNOW WHEN SHE IS SAYING I HAVE LAID AN EGG WE KNOW WHEN
SHE IS SAYING TO THE CHICKS RUN HERE DEARS IVE FOUND A WORM WE
KNOW WHAT SHE IS SAYING WHEN SHE VOICES A WARNING QUICK HURRY
GATHER YOURSELVES UNDER MAMMA THERES A HAWK COMING WE UNDERSTAND
THE CAT WHEN SHE STRETCHES HERSELF OUT PURRING WITH AFFECTION AND
CONTENTMENT AND LIFTS UP A SOFT VOICE AND SAYS COME KITTIES
SUPPERS READY WE UNDERSTAND HER WHEN SHE GOES MOURNING ABOUT AND
SAYS WHERE CAN THEY BE THEY ARE LOST WONT YOU HELP ME HUNT FOR
THEM AND WE UNDERSTAND THE DISREPUTABLE TOM WHEN HE CHALLENGES AT
MIDNIGHT FROM HIS SHED YOU COME OVER HERE YOU PRODUCT OF IMMORAL
COMMERCE AND ILL MAKE YOUR FUR FLY WE UNDERSTAND A FEW OF A DOGS
PHRASES AND WE LEARN TO UNDERSTAND A FEW OF THE REMARKS AND GESTURES OF
ANY BIRD OR OTHER ANIMAL THAT WE DOMESTICATE AND OBSERVE THE CLEARNESS
AND EXACTNESS OF THE FEW OF THE HENS SPEECHES WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IS
ARGUMENT THAT SHE CAN COMMUNICATE TO HER KIND A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WE
CANNOT COMPREHENDIN A WORD THAT SHE CAN CONVERSE AND THIS ARGUMENT
IS ALSO APPLICABLE IN THE CASE OF OTHERS OF THE GREAT ARMY OF THE
UNREVEALED IT IS JUST LIKE MANS VANITY AND IMPERTINENCE TO CALL AN
ANIMAL DUMB BECAUSE IT IS DUMB TO HIS DULL PERCEPTIONS NOW AS TO THE
ANT

YM YES GO BACK TO THE ANT THE CREATURE THATAS YOU SEEM TO
THINKSWEEPS AWAY THE LAST VESTIGE OF AN INTELLECTUAL FRONTIER BETWEEN
MAN AND THE UNREVEALED

OM THAT IS WHAT SHE SURELY DOES IN ALL HIS HISTORY THE ABORIGINAL
AUSTRALIAN NEVER THOUGHT OUT A HOUSE FOR HIMSELF AND BUILT IT THE ANT
IS AN AMAZING ARCHITECT SHE IS A WEE LITTLE CREATURE BUT SHE BUILDS A
STRONG AND ENDURING HOUSE EIGHT FEET HIGHA HOUSE WHICH IS AS LARGE IN
PROPORTION TO HER SIZE AS IS THE LARGEST CAPITOL OR CATHEDRAL IN THE
WORLD COMPARED TO MANS SIZE NO SAVAGE RACE HAS PRODUCED ARCHITECTS
WHO COULD APPROACH THE ANT IN GENIUS OR CULTURE NO CIVILIZED RACE HAS
PRODUCED ARCHITECTS WHO COULD PLAN A HOUSE BETTER FOR THE USES PROPOSED
THAN CAN HERS HER HOUSE CONTAINS A THRONEROOM NURSERIES FOR HER
YOUNG GRANARIES APARTMENTS FOR HER SOLDIERS HER WORKERS ETC AND
THEY AND THE MULTIFARIOUS HALLS AND CORRIDORS WHICH COMMUNICATE WITH
THEM ARE ARRANGED AND DISTRIBUTED WITH AN EDUCATED AND EXPERIENCED EYE
FOR CONVENIENCE AND ADAPTABILITY

YM THAT COULD BE MERE INSTINCT

OM IT WOULD ELEVATE THE SAVAGE IF HE HAD IT BUT LET US LOOK FURTHER
BEFORE WE DECIDE THE ANT HAS SOLDIERSBATTALIONS REGIMENTS ARMIES
AND THEY HAVE THEIR APPOINTED CAPTAINS AND GENERALS WHO LEAD THEM TO
BATTLE

YM THAT COULD BE INSTINCT TOO

OM WE WILL LOOK STILL FURTHER THE ANT HAS A SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IT
IS WELL PLANNED ELABORATE AND IS WELL CARRIED ON

YM INSTINCT AGAIN

OM SHE HAS CROWDS OF SLAVES AND IS A HARD AND UNJUST EMPLOYER OF
FORCED LABOR

YM INSTINCT

OM SHE HAS COWS AND MILKS THEM

YM INSTINCT OF COURSE

OM IN TEXAS SHE LAYS OUT A FARM TWELVE FEET SQUARE PLANTS IT WEEDS
IT CULTIVATES IT GATHERS THE CROP AND STORES IT AWAY

YM INSTINCT ALL THE SAME

OM THE ANT DISCRIMINATES BETWEEN FRIEND AND STRANGER SIR JOHN
LUBBOCK TOOK ANTS FROM TWO DIFFERENT NESTS MADE THEM DRUNK WITH
WHISKEY AND LAID THEM UNCONSCIOUS BY ONE OF THE NESTS NEAR SOME
WATER ANTS FROM THE NEST CAME AND EXAMINED AND DISCUSSED THESE
DISGRACED CREATURES THEN CARRIED THEIR FRIENDS HOME AND THREW THE
STRANGERS OVERBOARD SIR JOHN REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT A NUMBER OF
TIMES FOR A TIME THE SOBER ANTS DID AS THEY HAD DONE AT FIRSTCARRIED
THEIR FRIENDS HOME AND THREW THE STRANGERS OVERBOARD BUT FINALLY THEY
LOST PATIENCE SEEING THAT THEIR REFORMATORY EFFORTS WENT FOR NOTHING
AND THREW BOTH FRIENDS AND STRANGERS OVERBOARD COMEIS THIS INSTINCT
OR IS IT THOUGHTFUL AND INTELLIGENT DISCUSSION OF A THING
NEWABSOLUTELY NEWTO THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH A VERDICT ARRIVED AT
SENTENCE PASSED AND JUDGMENT EXECUTED IS IT INSTINCTTHOUGHT
PETRIFIED BY AGES OF HABITOR ISNT IT BRANDNEW THOUGHT INSPIRED BY
THE NEW OCCASION THE NEW CIRCUMSTANCES

YM I HAVE TO CONCEDE IT IT WAS NOT A RESULT OF HABIT IT HAS ALL THE
LOOK OF REFLECTION THOUGHT PUTTING THIS AND THAT TOGETHER AS YOU
PHRASE IT I BELIEVE IT WAS THOUGHT

OM I WILL GIVE YOU ANOTHER INSTANCE OF THOUGHT FRANKLIN HAD A CUP OF
SUGAR ON A TABLE IN HIS ROOM THE ANTS GOT AT IT HE TRIED SEVERAL
PREVENTIVES AND ANTS ROSE SUPERIOR TO THEM FINALLY HE CONTRIVED ONE
WHICH SHUT OFF ACCESSPROBABLY SET THE TABLES LEGS IN PANS OF WATER
OR DREW A CIRCLE OF TAR AROUND THE CUP I DONT REMEMBER AT ANY RATE
HE WATCHED TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD DO THEY TRIED VARIOUS
SCHEMESFAILURES EVERY ONE THE ANTS WERE BADLY PUZZLED FINALLY THEY
HELD A CONSULTATION DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM ARRIVED AT A DECISIONAND
THIS TIME THEY BEAT THAT GREAT PHILOSOPHER THEY FORMED IN PROCESSION
CROSS THE FLOOR CLIMBED THE WALL MARCHED ACROSS THE CEILING TO A
POINT JUST OVER THE CUP THEN ONE BY ONE THEY LET GO AND FELL DOWN INTO
IT WAS THAT INSTINCTTHOUGHT PETRIFIED BY AGES OF INHERITED HABIT

YM NO I DONT BELIEVE IT WAS I BELIEVE IT WAS A NEWLY REASONED
SCHEME TO MEET A NEW EMERGENCY

OM VERY WELL YOU HAVE CONCEDED THE REASONING POWER IN TWO INSTANCES
I COME NOW TO A MENTAL DETAIL WHEREIN THE ANT IS A LONG WAY THE
SUPERIOR OF ANY HUMAN BEING SIR JOHN LUBBOCK PROVED BY MANY
EXPERIMENTS THAT AN ANT KNOWS A STRANGER ANT OF HER OWN SPECIES IN A
MOMENT EVEN WHEN THE STRANGER IS DISGUISEDWITH PAINT ALSO HE PROVED
THAT AN ANT KNOWS EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN HER HIVE OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
SOULS ALSO AFTER A YEARS ABSENCE ONE OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
SHE WILL STRAIGHTWAY RECOGNIZE THE RETURNED ABSENTEE AND GRACE THE
RECOGNITION WITH AN AFFECTIONATE WELCOME HOW ARE THESE RECOGNITIONS
MADE NOT BY COLOR FOR PAINTED ANTS WERE RECOGNIZED NOT BY SMELL FOR
ANTS THAT HAD BEEN DIPPED IN CHLOROFORM WERE RECOGNIZED NOT BY SPEECH
AND NOT BY ANTENNAE SIGNS NOR CONTACTS FOR THE DRUNKEN AND MOTIONLESS
ANTS WERE RECOGNIZED AND THE FRIEND DISCRIMINATED FROM THE STRANGER
THE ANTS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SPECIES THEREFORE THE FRIENDS HAD TO BE
RECOGNIZED BY FORM AND FEATUREFRIENDS WHO FORMED PART OF A HIVE OF
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND HAS ANY MAN A MEMORY FOR FORM AND FEATURE
APPROACHING THAT

YM CERTAINLY NOT

OM FRANKLINS ANTS AND LUBBUCKS ANTS SHOW FINE CAPACITIES OF PUTTING
THIS AND THAT TOGETHER IN NEW AND UNTRIED EMERGENCIES AND DEDUCTING
SMART CONCLUSIONS FROM THE COMBINATIONSA MANS MENTAL PROCESS EXACTLY
WITH MEMORY TO HELP MAN PRESERVES HIS OBSERVATIONS AND REASONINGS
REFLECTS UPON THEM ADDS TO THEM RECOMBINES AND SO PROCEEDS STAGE BY
STAGE TO FAR RESULTSFROM THE TEAKETTLE TO THE OCEAN GREYHOUNDS
COMPLEX ENGINE FROM PERSONAL LABOR TO SLAVE LABOR FROM WIGWAM TO
PALACE FROM THE CAPRICIOUS CHASE TO AGRICULTURE AND STORED FOOD FROM
NOMADIC LIFE TO STABLE GOVERNMENT AND CONCENTRATED AUTHORITY FROM
INCOHERENT HORDES TO MASSED ARMIES THE ANT HAS OBSERVATION THE
REASONING FACULTY AND THE PRESERVING ADJUNCT OF A PRODIGIOUS MEMORY
SHE HAS DUPLICATED MANS DEVELOPMENT AND THE ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF HIS
CIVILIZATION AND YOU CALL IT ALL INSTINCT

YM PERHAPS I LACKED THE REASONING FACULTY MYSELF

OM WELL DONT TELL ANYBODY AND DONT DO IT AGAIN

YM WE HAVE COME A GOOD WAY AS A RESULTAS I UNDERSTAND ITI AM
REQUIRED TO CONCEDE THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO INTELLECTUAL FRONTIER
SEPARATING MAN AND THE UNREVEALED CREATURES

OM THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE REQUIRED TO CONCEDE THERE IS NO SUCH
FRONTIERTHERE IS NO WAY TO GET AROUND THAT MAN HAS A FINER AND MORE
CAPABLE MACHINE IN HIM THAN THOSE OTHERS BUT IT IS THE SAME MACHINE
AND WORKS IN THE SAME WAY AND NEITHER HE NOR THOSE OTHERS CAN COMMAND
THE MACHINEIT IS STRICTLY AUTOMATIC INDEPENDENT OF CONTROL WORKS
WHEN IT PLEASES AND WHEN IT DOESNT PLEASE IT CANT BE FORCED

YM THEN MAN AND THE OTHER ANIMALS ARE ALL ALIKE AS TO MENTAL
MACHINERY AND THERE ISNT ANY DIFFERENCE OF ANY STUPENDOUS MAGNITUDE
BETWEEN THEM EXCEPT IN QUALITY NOT IN KIND

OM THAT IS ABOUT THE STATE OF ITINTELLECTUALITY THERE ARE
PRONOUNCED LIMITATIONS ON BOTH SIDES WE CANT LEARN TO UNDERSTAND MUCH
OF THEIR LANGUAGE BUT THE DOG THE ELEPHANT ETC LEARN TO UNDERSTAND
A VERY GREAT DEAL OF OURS TO THAT EXTENT THEY ARE OUR SUPERIORS ON
THE OTHER HAND THEY CANT LEARN READING WRITING ETC NOR ANY OF OUR
FINE AND HIGH THINGS AND THERE WE HAVE A LARGE ADVANTAGE OVER THEM

YM VERY WELL LET THEM HAVE WHAT THEYVE GOT AND WELCOME THERE IS
STILL A WALL AND A LOFTY ONE THEY HAVENT GOT THE MORAL SENSE WE
HAVE IT AND IT LIFTS US IMMEASURABLY ABOVE THEM

OM WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT

YM NOW LOOK HERELETS CALL A HALT I HAVE STOOD THE OTHER INFAMIES
AND INSANITIES AND THAT IS ENOUGH I AM NOT GOING TO HAVE MAN AND THE
OTHER ANIMALS PUT ON THE SAME LEVEL MORALLY

OM I WASNT GOING TO HOIST MAN UP TO THAT

YM THIS IS TOO MUCH I THINK IT IS NOT RIGHT TO JEST ABOUT SUCH
THINGS

OM I AM NOT JESTING I AM MERELY REFLECTING A PLAIN AND SIMPLE
TRUTHAND WITHOUT UNCHARITABLENESS THE FACT THAT MAN KNOWS RIGHT FROM
WRONG PROVES HIS INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO THE OTHER CREATURES BUT
THE FACT THAT HE CAN DO WRONG PROVES HIS MORAL INFERIORITY TO ANY
CREATURE THAT CANNOT IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THIS POSITION IS NOT
ASSAILABLE

FREE WILL

YM WHAT IS YOUR OPINION REGARDING FREE WILL

OM THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING DID THE MAN POSSESS IT WHO GAVE THE
OLD WOMAN HIS LAST SHILLING AND TRUDGED HOME IN THE STORM

YM HE HAD THE CHOICE BETWEEN SUCCORING THE OLD WOMAN AND LEAVING HER
TO SUFFER ISNT IT SO

OM YES THERE WAS A CHOICE TO BE MADE BETWEEN BODILY COMFORT ON THE
ONE HAND AND THE COMFORT OF THE SPIRIT ON THE OTHER THE BODY MADE A
STRONG APPEAL OF COURSETHE BODY WOULD BE QUITE SURE TO DO THAT THE
SPIRIT MADE A COUNTER APPEAL A CHOICE HAD TO BE MADE BETWEEN THE TWO
APPEALS AND WAS MADE WHO OR WHAT DETERMINED THAT CHOICE

YM ANY ONE BUT YOU WOULD SAY THAT THE MAN DETERMINED IT AND THAT IN
DOING IT HE EXERCISED FREE WILL

OM WE ARE CONSTANTLY ASSURED THAT EVERY MAN IS ENDOWED WITH FREE
WILL AND THAT HE CAN AND MUST EXERCISE IT WHERE HE IS OFFERED A CHOICE
BETWEEN GOOD CONDUCT AND LESSGOOD CONDUCT YET WE CLEARLY SAW THAT IN
THAT MANS CASE HE REALLY HAD NO FREE WILL HIS TEMPERAMENT HIS
TRAINING AND THE DAILY INFLUENCES WHICH HAD MOLDED HIM AND MADE HIM
WHAT HE WAS COMPELLED HIM TO RESCUE THE OLD WOMAN AND THUS SAVE
HIMSELF SAVE HIMSELF FROM SPIRITUAL PAIN FROM UNENDURABLE
WRETCHEDNESS HE DID NOT MAKE THE CHOICE IT WAS MADE FOR HIM BY
FORCES WHICH HE COULD NOT CONTROL FREE WILL HAS ALWAYS EXISTED IN
WORDS BUT IT STOPS THERE I THINKSTOPS SHORT OF FACT I WOULD NOT
USE THOSE WORDSFREE WILLBUT OTHERS

YM WHAT OTHERS

OM FREE CHOICE

YM WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE

OM THE ONE IMPLIES UNTRAMMELED POWER TO ACT AS YOU PLEASE THE
OTHER IMPLIES NOTHING BEYOND A MERE MENTAL PROCESS THE CRITICAL
ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHICH OF TWO THINGS IS NEAREST RIGHT AND JUST

YM MAKE THE DIFFERENCE CLEAR PLEASE

OM THE MIND CAN FREELY SELECT CHOOSE POINT OUT THE RIGHT AND JUST
ONEITS FUNCTION STOPS THERE IT CAN GO NO FURTHER IN THE MATTER IT
HAS NO AUTHORITY TO SAY THAT THE RIGHT ONE SHALL BE ACTED UPON AND THE
WRONG ONE DISCARDED THAT AUTHORITY IS IN OTHER HANDS

YM THE MANS

OM IN THE MACHINE WHICH STANDS FOR HIM IN HIS BORN DISPOSITION AND
THE CHARACTER WHICH HAS BEEN BUILT AROUND IT BY TRAINING AND
ENVIRONMENT

YM IT WILL ACT UPON THE RIGHT ONE OF THE TWO

OM IT WILL DO AS IT PLEASES IN THE MATTER GEORGE WASHINGTONS
MACHINE WOULD ACT UPON THE RIGHT ONE PIZARRO WOULD ACT UPON THE WRONG
ONE

YM THEN AS I UNDERSTAND IT A BAD MANS MENTAL MACHINERY CALMLY AND
JUDICIALLY POINTS OUT WHICH OF TWO THINGS IS RIGHT AND JUST

OM YES AND HIS MORAL MACHINERY WILL FREELY ACT UPON THE ONE OR THE
OTHER ACCORDING TO ITS MAKE AND BE QUITE INDIFFERENT TO THE MINDS
FEELING CONCERNING THE MATTERTHAT IS WOULD BE IF THE MIND HAD ANY
FEELINGS WHICH IT HASNT IT IS MERELY A THERMOMETER IT REGISTERS THE
HEAT AND THE COLD AND CARES NOT A FARTHING ABOUT EITHER

YM THEN WE MUST NOT CLAIM THAT IF A MAN KNOWS WHICH OF TWO THINGS
IS RIGHT HE IS ABSOLUTELY BOUND TO DO THAT THING

OM HIS TEMPERAMENT AND TRAINING WILL DECIDE WHAT HE SHALL DO AND HE
WILL DO IT HE CANNOT HELP HIMSELF HE HAS NO AUTHORITY OVER THE
MATTER WASNT IT RIGHT FOR DAVID TO GO OUT AND SLAY GOLIATH

YM YES

OM THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUALLY RIGHT FOR ANY ONE ELSE TO DO IT

YM CERTAINLY

OM THEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT FOR A BORN COWARD TO ATTEMPT IT

YM IT WOULDYES

OM YOU KNOW THAT NO BORN COWARD EVER WOULD HAVE ATTEMPTED IT DONT
YOU

YM YES

OM YOU KNOW THAT A BORN COWARDS MAKE AND TEMPERAMENT WOULD BE AN
ABSOLUTE AND INSURMOUNTABLE BAR TO HIS EVER ESSAYING SUCH A THING
DONT YOU

YM YES I KNOW IT

OM HE CLEARLY PERCEIVES THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT TO TRY IT

YM YES

OM HIS MIND HAS FREE CHOICE IN DETERMINING THAT IT WOULD BE RIGHT
TO TRY IT

YM YES

OM THEN IF BY REASON OF HIS INBORN COWARDICE HE SIMPLY CAN NOT
ESSAY IT WHAT BECOMES OF HIS FREE WILL WHERE IS HIS FREE WILL WHY
CLAIM THAT HE HAS FREE WILL WHEN THE PLAIN FACTS SHOW THAT HE HASNT
WHY CONTEND THAT BECAUSE HE AND DAVID SEE THE RIGHT ALIKE BOTH MUST
ACT ALIKE WHY IMPOSE THE SAME LAWS UPON GOAT AND LION

YM THERE IS REALLY NO SUCH THING AS FREE WILL

OM IT IS WHAT I THINK THERE IS WILL BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH
INTELLECTUAL PERCEPTIONS OF RIGHT AND WRONG AND IS NOT UNDER THEIR
COMMAND DAVIDS TEMPERAMENT AND TRAINING HAD WILL AND IT WAS A
COMPULSORY FORCE DAVID HAD TO OBEY ITS DECREES HE HAD NO CHOICE THE
COWARDS TEMPERAMENT AND TRAINING POSSESS WILL AND IT IS COMPULSORY
IT COMMANDS HIM TO AVOID DANGER AND HE OBEYS HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT
NEITHER THE DAVIDS NOR THE COWARDS POSSESS FREE WILLWILL THAT MAY DO
THE RIGHT OR DO THE WRONG AS THEIR MENTAL VERDICT SHALL DECIDE

NOT TWO VALUES BUT ONLY ONE

YM THERE IS ONE THING WHICH BOTHERS ME I CANT TELL WHERE YOU DRAW
THE LINE BETWEEN MATERIAL COVETOUSNESS AND SPIRITUAL COVETOUSNESS

OM I DONT DRAW ANY

YM HOW DO YOU MEAN

OM THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS MATERIAL COVETOUSNESS ALL
COVETOUSNESS IS SPIRITUAL

YM ALL LONGINGS DESIRES AMBITIONS SPIRITUAL NEVER MATERIAL

OM YES THE MASTER IN YOU REQUIRES THAT IN ALL CASES YOU SHALL
CONTENT HIS SPIRIT THAT ALONE HE NEVER REQUIRES ANYTHING ELSE HE
NEVER INTERESTS HIMSELF IN ANY OTHER MATTER

YM AH COME WHEN HE COVETS SOMEBODYS MONEYISNT THAT RATHER
DISTINCTLY MATERIAL AND GROSS

OM NO THE MONEY IS MERELY A SYMBOLIT REPRESENTS IN VISIBLE AND
CONCRETE FORM A SPIRITUAL DESIRE ANY SOCALLED MATERIAL THING THAT
YOU WANT IS MERELY A SYMBOL YOU WANT IT NOT FOR ITSELF BUT BECAUSE
IT WILL CONTENT YOUR SPIRIT FOR THE MOMENT

YM PLEASE PARTICULARIZE

OM VERY WELL MAYBE THE THING LONGED FOR IS A NEW HAT YOU GET IT AND
YOUR VANITY IS PLEASED YOUR SPIRIT CONTENTED SUPPOSE YOUR FRIENDS
DERIDE THE HAT MAKE FUN OF IT AT ONCE IT LOSES ITS VALUE YOU ARE
ASHAMED OF IT YOU PUT IT OUT OF YOUR SIGHT YOU NEVER WANT TO SEE IT
AGAIN

YM I THINK I SEE GO ON

OM IT IS THE SAME HAT ISNT IT IT IS IN NO WAY ALTERED BUT IT
WASNT THE HAT YOU WANTED BUT ONLY WHAT IT STOOD FORA SOMETHING TO
PLEASE AND CONTENT YOUR SPIRIT WHEN IT FAILED OF THAT THE WHOLE OF
ITS VALUE WAS GONE THERE ARE NO MATERIAL VALUES THERE ARE ONLY
SPIRITUAL ONES YOU WILL HUNT IN VAIN FOR A MATERIAL VALUE THAT IS
ACTUAL REALTHERE IS NO SUCH THING THE ONLY VALUE IT POSSESSES FOR
EVEN A MOMENT IS THE SPIRITUAL VALUE BACK OF IT REMOVE THAT END AND
IT IS AT ONCE WORTHLESSLIKE THE HAT

YM CAN YOU EXTEND THAT TO MONEY

OM YES IT IS MERELY A SYMBOL IT HAS NO MATERIAL VALUE YOU THINK
YOU DESIRE IT FOR ITS OWN SAKE BUT IT IS NOT SO YOU DESIRE IT FOR THE
SPIRITUAL CONTENT IT WILL BRING IF IT FAIL OF THAT YOU DISCOVER THAT
ITS VALUE IS GONE THERE IS THAT PATHETIC TALE OF THE MAN WHO LABORED
LIKE A SLAVE UNRESTING UNSATISFIED UNTIL HE HAD ACCUMULATED A
FORTUNE AND WAS HAPPY OVER IT JUBILANT ABOUT IT THEN IN A SINGLE
WEEK A PESTILENCE SWEPT AWAY ALL WHOM HE HELD DEAR AND LEFT HIM
DESOLATE HIS MONEYS VALUE WAS GONE HE REALIZED THAT HIS JOY IN IT
CAME NOT FROM THE MONEY ITSELF BUT FROM THE SPIRITUAL CONTENTMENT HE
GOT OUT OF HIS FAMILYS ENJOYMENT OF THE PLEASURES AND DELIGHTS IT
LAVISHED UPON THEM MONEY HAS NO MATERIAL VALUE IF YOU REMOVE ITS
SPIRITUAL VALUE NOTHING IS LEFT BUT DROSS IT IS SO WITH ALL THINGS
LITTLE OR BIG MAJESTIC OR TRIVIALTHERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS CROWNS
SCEPTERS PENNIES PASTE JEWELS VILLAGE NOTORIETY WORLDWIDE
FAMETHEY ARE ALL THE SAME THEY HAVE NO MATERIAL VALUE WHILE THEY
CONTENT THE SPIRIT THEY ARE PRECIOUS WHEN THIS FAILS THEY ARE
WORTHLESS

A DIFFICULT QUESTION

YM YOU KEEP ME CONFUSED AND PERPLEXED ALL THE TIME BY YOUR ELUSIVE
TERMINOLOGY SOMETIMES YOU DIVIDE A MAN UP INTO TWO OR THREE SEPARATE
PERSONALITIES EACH WITH AUTHORITIES JURISDICTIONS AND
RESPONSIBILITIES OF ITS OWN AND WHEN HE IS IN THAT CONDITION I CANT
GRASP IT NOW WHEN I SPEAK OF A MAN HE IS THE WHOLE THING IN ONE
AND EASY TO HOLD AND CONTEMPLATE

OM THAT IS PLEASANT AND CONVENIENT IF TRUE WHEN YOU SPEAK OF MY
BODY WHO IS THE MY

YM IT IS THE ME

OM THE BODY IS A PROPERTY THEN AND THE ME OWNS IT WHO IS THE ME

YM THE ME IS THE WHOLE THING IT IS A COMMON PROPERTY AN UNDIVIDED
OWNERSHIP VESTED IN THE WHOLE ENTITY

OM IF THE ME ADMIRES A RAINBOW IS IT THE WHOLE ME THAT ADMIRES IT
INCLUDING THE HAIR HANDS HEELS AND ALL

YM CERTAINLY NOT IT IS MY MIND THAT ADMIRES IT

OM SO YOU DIVIDE THE ME YOURSELF EVERYBODY DOES EVERYBODY MUST
WHAT THEN DEFINITELY IS THE ME

YM I THINK IT MUST CONSIST OF JUST THOSE TWO PARTSTHE BODY AND THE
MIND

OM YOU THINK SO IF YOU SAY I BELIEVE THE WORLD IS ROUND WHO IS
THE I THAT IS SPEAKING

YM THE MIND

OM IF YOU SAY I GRIEVE FOR THE LOSS OF MY FATHER WHO IS THE I

YM THE MIND

OM IS THE MIND EXERCISING AN INTELLECTUAL FUNCTION WHEN IT EXAMINES
AND ACCEPTS THE EVIDENCE THAT THE WORLD IS ROUND

YM YES

OM IS IT EXERCISING AN INTELLECTUAL FUNCTION WHEN IT GRIEVES FOR THE
LOSS OF YOUR FATHER

YM THAT IS NOT CEREBRATION BRAINWORK IT IS A MATTER OF FEELING

OM THEN ITS SOURCE IS NOT IN YOUR MIND BUT IN YOUR MORAL
TERRITORY

YM I HAVE TO GRANT IT

OM IS YOUR MIND A PART OF YOUR PHYSICAL EQUIPMENT

YM NO IT IS INDEPENDENT OF IT IT IS SPIRITUAL

OM BEING SPIRITUAL IT CANNOT BE AFFECTED BY PHYSICAL INFLUENCES

YM NO

OM DOES THE MIND REMAIN SOBER WITH THE BODY IS DRUNK

YM WELLNO

OM THERE IS A PHYSICAL EFFECT PRESENT THEN

YM IT LOOKS LIKE IT

OM A CRACKED SKULL HAS RESULTED IN A CRAZY MIND WHY SHOULD IT HAPPEN
IF THE MIND IS SPIRITUAL AND INDEPENDENT OF PHYSICAL INFLUENCES

YM WELLI DONT KNOW

OM WHEN YOU HAVE A PAIN IN YOUR FOOT HOW DO YOU KNOW IT

YM I FEEL IT

OM BUT YOU DO NOT FEEL IT UNTIL A NERVE REPORTS THE HURT TO THE
BRAIN YET THE BRAIN IS THE SEAT OF THE MIND IS IT NOT

YM I THINK SO

OM BUT ISNT SPIRITUAL ENOUGH TO LEARN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE
OUTSKIRTS WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE PHYSICAL MESSENGER YOU PERCEIVE
THAT THE QUESTION OF WHO OR WHAT THE ME IS IS NOT A SIMPLE ONE AT ALL
YOU SAY I ADMIRE THE RAINBOW AND I BELIEVE THE WORLD IS ROUND AND
IN THESE CASES WE FIND THAT THE ME IS NOT SPEAKING BUT ONLY THE
MENTAL PART YOU SAY I GRIEVE AND AGAIN THE ME IS NOT ALL
SPEAKING BUT ONLY THE MORAL PART YOU SAY THE MIND IS WHOLLY
SPIRITUAL THEN YOU SAY I HAVE A PAIN AND FIND THAT THIS TIME THE ME
IS MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL COMBINED WE ALL USE THE I IN THIS
INDETERMINATE FASHION THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT WE IMAGINE A MASTER AND
KING OVER WHAT YOU CALL THE WHOLE THING AND WE SPEAK OF HIM AS I
BUT WHEN WE TRY TO DEFINE HIM WE FIND WE CANNOT DO IT THE INTELLECT
AND THE FEELINGS CAN ACT QUITE INDEPENDENTLY OF EACH OTHER WE
RECOGNIZE THAT AND WE LOOK AROUND FOR A RULER WHO IS MASTER OVER BOTH
AND CAN SERVE AS A DEFINITE AND INDISPUTABLE I AND ENABLE US TO
KNOW WHAT WE MEAN AND WHO OR WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE USE THAT
PRONOUN BUT WE HAVE TO GIVE IT UP AND CONFESS THAT WE CANNOT FIND HIM
TO ME MAN IS A MACHINE MADE UP OF MANY MECHANISMS THE MORAL AND
MENTAL ONES ACTING AUTOMATICALLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE IMPULSES OF AN
INTERIOR MASTER WHO IS BUILT OUT OF BORNTEMPERAMENT AND AN
ACCUMULATION OF MULTITUDINOUS OUTSIDE INFLUENCES AND TRAININGS A
MACHINE WHOSE ONE FUNCTION IS TO SECURE THE SPIRITUAL CONTENTMENT OF
THE MASTER BE HIS DESIRES GOOD OR BE THEY EVIL A MACHINE WHOSE WILL
IS ABSOLUTE AND MUST BE OBEYED AND ALWAYS IS OBEYED

YM MAYBE THE ME IS THE SOUL

OM MAYBE IT IS WHAT IS THE SOUL

YM I DONT KNOW

OM NEITHER DOES ANY ONE ELSE

THE MASTER PASSION

YM WHAT IS THE MASTEROR IN COMMON SPEECH THE CONSCIENCE EXPLAIN
IT

OM IT IS THAT MYSTERIOUS AUTOCRAT LODGED IN A MAN WHICH COMPELS THE
MAN TO CONTENT ITS DESIRES IT MAY BE CALLED THE MASTER PASSIONTHE
HUNGER FOR SELFAPPROVAL

YM WHERE IS ITS SEAT

OM IN MANS MORAL CONSTITUTION

YM ARE ITS COMMANDS FOR THE MANS GOOD

OM IT IS INDIFFERENT TO THE MANS GOOD IT NEVER CONCERNS ITSELF
ABOUT ANYTHING BUT THE SATISFYING OF ITS OWN DESIRES IT CAN BE
TRAINED TO PREFER THINGS WHICH WILL BE FOR THE MANS GOOD BUT IT
WILL PREFER THEM ONLY BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTENT IT BETTER THAN OTHER
THINGS WOULD

YM THEN EVEN WHEN IT IS TRAINED TO HIGH IDEALS IT IS STILL LOOKING
OUT FOR ITS OWN CONTENTMENT AND NOT FOR THE MANS GOOD

OM TRUE TRAINED OR UNTRAINED IT CARES NOTHING FOR THE MANS GOOD
AND NEVER CONCERNS ITSELF ABOUT IT

YM IT SEEMS TO BE AN IMMORAL FORCE SEATED IN THE MANS MORAL
CONSTITUTION

OM IT IS A COLORLESS FORCE SEATED IN THE MANS MORAL CONSTITUTION
LET US CALL IT AN INSTINCTA BLIND UNREASONING INSTINCT WHICH CANNOT
AND DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN GOOD MORALS AND BAD ONES AND CARES
NOTHING FOR RESULTS TO THE MAN PROVIDED ITS OWN CONTENTMENT BE SECURED
AND IT WILL ALWAYS SECURE THAT

YM IT SEEKS MONEY AND IT PROBABLY CONSIDERS THAT THAT IS AN
ADVANTAGE FOR THE MAN

OM IT IS NOT ALWAYS SEEKING MONEY IT IS NOT ALWAYS SEEKING POWER
NOR OFFICE NOR ANY OTHER MATERIAL ADVANTAGE IN ALL CASES IT SEEKS
A SPIRITUAL CONTENTMENT LET THE MEANS BE WHAT THEY MAY ITS
DESIRES ARE DETERMINED BY THE MANS TEMPERAMENTAND IT IS LORD OVER
THAT TEMPERAMENT CONSCIENCE SUSCEPTIBILITY SPIRITUAL APPETITE ARE
IN FACT THE SAME THING HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A PERSON WHO CARED
NOTHING FOR MONEY

YM YES A SCHOLAR WHO WOULD NOT LEAVE HIS GARRET AND HIS BOOKS TO
TAKE A PLACE IN A BUSINESS HOUSE AT A LARGE SALARY

OM HE HAD TO SATISFY HIS MASTERTHAT IS TO SAY HIS TEMPERAMENT HIS
SPIRITUAL APPETITEAND IT PREFERRED BOOKS TO MONEY ARE THERE OTHER
CASES

YM YES THE HERMIT

OM IT IS A GOOD INSTANCE THE HERMIT ENDURES SOLITUDE HUNGER COLD
AND MANIFOLD PERILS TO CONTENT HIS AUTOCRAT WHO PREFERS THESE THINGS
AND PRAYER AND CONTEMPLATION TO MONEY OR TO ANY SHOW OR LUXURY THAT
MONEY CAN BUY ARE THERE OTHERS

YM YES THE ARTIST THE POET THE SCIENTIST

OM THEIR AUTOCRAT PREFERS THE DEEP PLEASURES OF THESE OCCUPATIONS
EITHER WELL PAID OR ILL PAID TO ANY OTHERS IN THE MARKET AT ANY
PRICE YOU REALIZE THAT THE MASTER PASSIONTHE CONTENTMENT OF THE
SPIRITCONCERNS ITSELF WITH MANY THINGS BESIDES SOCALLED MATERIAL
ADVANTAGE MATERIAL PROSPERITY CASH AND ALL THAT

YM I THINK I MUST CONCEDE IT

OM I BELIEVE YOU MUST THERE ARE PERHAPS AS MANY TEMPERAMENTS THAT
WOULD REFUSE THE BURDENS AND VEXATIONS AND DISTINCTIONS OF PUBLIC
OFFICE AS THERE ARE THAT HUNGER AFTER THEM THE ONE SET OF TEMPERAMENTS
SEEK THE CONTENTMENT OF THE SPIRIT AND THAT ALONE AND THIS IS EXACTLY
THE CASE WITH THE OTHER SET NEITHER SET SEEKS ANYTHING BUT THE
CONTENTMENT OF THE SPIRIT IF THE ONE IS SORDID BOTH ARE SORDID AND
EQUALLY SO SINCE THE END IN VIEW IS PRECISELY THE SAME IN BOTH CASES
AND IN BOTH CASES TEMPERAMENT DECIDES THE PREFERENCEAND TEMPERAMENT IS
BORN NOT MADE

CONCLUSION

OM YOU HAVE BEEN TAKING A HOLIDAY

YM YES A MOUNTAIN TRAMP COVERING A WEEK ARE YOU READY TO TALK

OM QUITE READY WHAT SHALL WE BEGIN WITH

HAS HALFINTENDED TO ORDER ME TO SET THEM TO PAPER AND PUBLISH THEM DO
I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY THE ORDER HAS REMAINED UNISSUED OR CAN YOU

INFLUENCES DETERRED HIM WITHOUT THE OUTSIDE INFLUENCES NEITHER OF
THESE IMPULSES COULD EVER HAVE BEEN BORN SINCE A PERSONS BRAIN IS
INCAPABLE OR ORIGINATING AN IDEA WITHIN ITSELF

OM CORRECT GO ON

YM THE MATTER OF PUBLISHING OR WITHHOLDING IS STILL IN YOUR MASTERS
HANDS IF SOME DAY AN OUTSIDE INFLUENCE SHALL DETERMINE HIM TO PUBLISH

IS THE SUPREME MARVEL OF THE CREATION HE BELIEVES IT IN ALL THE AGES
HE HAS NEVER DOUBTED IT WHETHER HE WAS A NAKED SAVAGE OR CLOTHED IN
PURPLE AND FINE LINEN AND CIVILIZED THIS HAS MADE HIS HEART BUOYANT
HIS LIFE CHEERY HIS PRIDE IN HIMSELF HIS SINCERE ADMIRATION OF
HIMSELF HIS JOY IN WHAT HE SUPPOSED WERE HIS OWN AND UNASSISTED
ACHIEVEMENTS AND HIS EXULTATION OVER THE PRAISE AND APPLAUSE WHICH

TWOTHIRDS UNHAPPY NO POLITICAL OR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS CAN CHANGE THE
PROPORTIONS THE VAST MAJORITY OF TEMPERAMENTS ARE PRETTY EQUALLY

THE DEATH OF JEAN


THE DEATH OF JEAN CLEMENS OCCURRED EARLY IN THE MORNING OF DECEMBER
MR CLEMENS WAS IN GREAT STRESS OF MIND WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM BUT
A FEW HOURS LATER I FOUND HIM WRITING STEADILY

I AM SETTING IT DOWN HE SAID EVERYTHING IT IS A RELIEF TO ME TO
WRITE IT IT FURNISHES ME AN EXCUSE FOR THINKING AT INTERVALS DURING
THAT DAY AND THE NEXT I LOOKED IN AND USUALLY FOUND HIM WRITING THEN
ON THE EVENING OF THE TH WHEN HE KNEW THAT JEAN HAD BEEN LAID TO
REST IN ELMIRA HE CAME TO MY ROOM WITH THE MANUSCRIPT IN HIS HAND

I HAVE FINISHED IT HE SAID READ IT I CAN FORM NO OPINION OF IT
MYSELF IF YOU THINK IT WORTHY SOME DAYAT THE PROPER TIMEIT CAN END
MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY IT IS THE FINAL CHAPTER

FOUR MONTHS LATERALMOST TO THE DAYAPRIL ST HE WAS WITH JEAN

ALBERT BIGELOW PAINE

MIND IN A FLOOD THEY ARE LITTLE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN ALWAYS HAPPENING
EVERY DAY AND WERE ALWAYS SO UNIMPORTANT AND EASILY FORGETTABLE
BEFOREBUT NOW NOW HOW DIFFERENT HOW PRECIOUS THEY ARE HOW DEAR

THE FLOOR AND COVERED WITH A SHEET AND LOOKING SO PLACID SO NATURAL
AND AS IF ASLEEP WE KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED SHE WAS AN EPILEPTIC SHE
HAD BEEN SEIZED WITH A CONVULSION AND HEART FAILURE IN HER BATH THE
DOCTOR HAD TO COME SEVERAL MILES HIS EFFORTS LIKE OUR PREVIOUS ONES

BEAR HER TO ELMIRA NEW YORK WHERE LIE THOSE OF US THAT HAVE BEEN
RELEASED BUT I SHALL NOT FOLLOW

JEAN WAS ON THE DOCK WHEN THE SHIP CAME IN ONLY FOUR DAYS AGO SHE WAS
AT THE DOOR BEAMING A WELCOME WHEN I REACHED THIS HOUSE THE NEXT
EVENING WE PLAYED CARDS AND SHE TRIED TO TEACH ME A NEW GAME CALLED
MARK TWAIN WE SAT CHATTING CHEERILY IN THE LIBRARY LAST NIGHT AND
SHE WOULDNT LET ME LOOK INTO THE LOGGIA WHERE SHE WAS MAKING
CHRISTMAS PREPARATIONS SHE SAID SHE WOULD FINISH THEM IN THE MORNING
AND THEN HER LITTLE FRENCH FRIEND WOULD ARRIVE FROM NEW YORKTHE
SURPRISE WOULD FOLLOW THE SURPRISE SHE HAD BEEN WORKING OVER FOR DAYS
WHILE SHE WAS OUT FOR A MOMENT I DISLOYALLY STOLE A LOOK THE LOGGIA
FLOOR WAS CLOTHED WITH RUGS AND FURNISHED WITH CHAIRS AND SOFAS AND
THE UNCOMPLETED SURPRISE WAS THERE IN THE FORM OF A CHRISTMAS TREE
THAT WAS DRENCHED WITH SILVER FILM IN A MOST WONDERFUL WAY AND ON A
TABLE WAS A PRODIGAL PROFUSION OF BRIGHT THINGS WHICH SHE WAS GOING TO
HANG UPON IT TODAY WHAT DESECRATING HAND WILL EVER BANISH THAT
ELOQUENT UNFINISHED SURPRISE FROM THAT PLACE NOT MINE SURELY ALL
THESE LITTLE MATTERS HAVE HAPPENED IN THE LAST FOUR DAYS LITTLE
YESTHEN BUT NOT NOW NOTHING SHE SAID OR THOUGHT OR DID IS LITTLE
NOW AND ALL THE LAVISH HUMORWHAT IS BECOME OF IT IT IS PATHOS NOW
PATHOS AND THE THOUGHT OF IT BRINGS TEARS

ALL THESE LITTLE THINGS HAPPENED SUCH A FEW HOURS AGOAND NOW SHE LIES
YONDER LIES YONDER AND CARES FOR NOTHING ANY MORE
STRANGEMARVELOUSINCREDIBLE I HAVE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE BEFORE BUT IT
WOULD STILL BE INCREDIBLE IF I HAD HAD IT A THOUSAND TIMES

MISS JEAN IS DEAD

THAT IS WHAT KATY SAID WHEN I HEARD THE DOOR OPEN BEHIND THE BEDS
HEAD WITHOUT A PRELIMINARY KNOCK I SUPPOSED IT WAS JEAN COMING TO KISS
ME GOOD MORNING SHE BEING THE ONLY PERSON WHO WAS USED TO ENTERING
WITHOUT FORMALITIES

AND SO

I HAVE BEEN TO JEANS PARLOR SUCH A TURMOIL OF CHRISTMAS PRESENTS FOR
SERVANTS AND FRIENDS THEY ARE EVERYWHERE TABLES CHAIRS SOFAS THE
FLOOREVERYTHING IS OCCUPIED AND OVEROCCUPIED IT IS MANY AND MANY A
YEAR SINCE I HAVE SEEN THE LIKE IN THAT ANCIENT DAY MRS CLEMENS AND I
USED TO SLIP SOFTLY INTO THE NURSERY AT MIDNIGHT ON CHRISTMAS EVE AND
LOOK THE ARRAY OF PRESENTS OVER THE CHILDREN WERE LITTLE THEN AND NOW
HERE IS JEANS PARLOR LOOKING JUST AS THAT NURSERY USED TO LOOK THE
PRESENTS ARE NOT LABELEDTHE HANDS ARE FOREVER IDLE THAT WOULD HAVE
LABELED THEM TODAY JEANS MOTHER ALWAYS WORKED HERSELF DOWN WITH HER
CHRISTMAS PREPARATIONS JEAN DID THE SAME YESTERDAY AND THE PRECEDING
DAYS AND THE FATIGUE HAS COST HER HER LIFE THE FATIGUE CAUSED THE
CONVULSION THAT ATTACKED HER THIS MORNING SHE HAD HAD NO ATTACK FOR
MONTHS

JEAN WAS SO FULL OF LIFE AND ENERGY THAT SHE WAS CONSTANTLY IN DANGER
OF OVERTAXING HER STRENGTH EVERY MORNING SHE WAS IN THE SADDLE BY HALF
PAST SEVEN AND OFF TO THE STATION FOR HER MAIL SHE EXAMINED THE
LETTERS AND I DISTRIBUTED THEM SOME TO HER SOME TO MR PAINE THE
OTHERS TO THE STENOGRAPHER AND MYSELF SHE DISPATCHED HER SHARE AND
THEN MOUNTED HER HORSE AGAIN AND WENT AROUND SUPERINTENDING HER FARM
AND HER POULTRY THE REST OF THE DAY SOMETIMES SHE PLAYED BILLIARDS
WITH ME AFTER DINNER BUT SHE WAS USUALLY TOO TIRED TO PLAY AND WENT
EARLY TO BED

YESTERDAY AFTERNOON I TOLD HER ABOUT SOME PLANS I HAD BEEN DEVISING
WHILE ABSENT IN BERMUDA TO LIGHTEN HER BURDENS WE WOULD GET A
HOUSEKEEPER ALSO WE WOULD PUT HER SHARE OF THE SECRETARYWORK INTO MR
PAINES HANDS

NOSHE WASNT WILLING SHE HAD BEEN MAKING PLANS HERSELF THE MATTER
ENDED IN A COMPROMISE I SUBMITTED I ALWAYS DID SHE WOULDNT AUDIT
THE BILLS AND LET PAINE FILL OUT THE CHECKSSHE WOULD CONTINUE TO
ATTEND TO THAT HERSELF ALSO SHE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE HOUSEKEEPER AND
LET KATY ASSIST ALSO SHE WOULD CONTINUE TO ANSWER THE LETTERS OF
PERSONAL FRIENDS FOR ME SUCH WAS THE COMPROMISE BOTH OF US CALLED IT
BY THAT NAME THOUGH I WAS NOT ABLE TO SEE WHERE ANY FORMIDABLE CHANGE
HAD BEEN MADE

HOWEVER JEAN WAS PLEASED AND THAT WAS SUFFICIENT FOR ME SHE WAS
PROUD OF BEING MY SECRETARY AND I WAS NEVER ABLE TO PERSUADE HER TO
GIVE UP ANY PART OF HER SHARE IN THAT UNLOVELY WORK

IN THE TALK LAST NIGHT I SAID I FOUND EVERYTHING GOING SO SMOOTHLY THAT
IF SHE WERE WILLING I WOULD GO BACK TO BERMUDA IN FEBRUARY AND GET
BLESSEDLY OUT OF THE CLASH AND TURMOIL AGAIN FOR ANOTHER MONTH SHE WAS
URGENT THAT I SHOULD DO IT AND SAID THAT IF I WOULD PUT OFF THE TRIP
UNTIL MARCH SHE WOULD TAKE KATY AND GO WITH ME WE STRUCK HANDS UPON
THAT AND SAID IT WAS SETTLED I HAD A MIND TO WRITE TO BERMUDA BY
TOMORROWS SHIP AND SECURE A FURNISHED HOUSE AND SERVANTS I MEANT TO
WRITE THE LETTER THIS MORNING BUT IT WILL NEVER BE WRITTEN NOW

FOR SHE LIES YONDER AND BEFORE HER IS ANOTHER JOURNEY THAN THAT

NIGHT IS CLOSING DOWN THE RIM OF THE SUN BARELY SHOWS ABOVE THE
SKYLINE OF THE HILLS

I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THAT FACE AGAIN THAT WAS GROWING DEARER AND
DEARER TO ME EVERY DAY I WAS GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH JEAN IN THESE
LAST NINE MONTHS SHE HAD BEEN LONG AN EXILE FROM HOME WHEN SHE CAME TO
US THREEQUARTERS OF A YEAR AGO SHE HAD BEEN SHUT UP IN SANITARIUMS
MANY MILES FROM US HOW ELOQUENTLY GLAD AND GRATEFUL SHE WAS TO CROSS
HER FATHERS THRESHOLD AGAIN

WOULD I BRING HER BACK TO LIFE IF I COULD DO IT I WOULD NOT IF A WORD
WOULD DO IT I WOULD BEG FOR STRENGTH TO WITHHOLD THE WORD AND I WOULD
HAVE THE STRENGTH I AM SURE OF IT IN HER LOSS I AM ALMOST BANKRUPT
AND MY LIFE IS A BITTERNESS BUT I AM CONTENT FOR SHE HAS BEEN
ENRICHED WITH THE MOST PRECIOUS OF ALL GIFTSTHAT GIFT WHICH MAKES ALL
OTHER GIFTS MEAN AND POORDEATH I HAVE NEVER WANTED ANY RELEASED
FRIEND OF MINE RESTORED TO LIFE SINCE I REACHED MANHOOD I FELT IN THIS
WAY WHEN SUSY PASSED AWAY AND LATER MY WIFE AND LATER MR ROGERS
WHEN CLARA MET ME AT THE STATION IN NEW YORK AND TOLD ME MR ROGERS HAD
DIED SUDDENLY THAT MORNING MY THOUGHT WAS OH FAVORITE OF
FORTUNEFORTUNATE ALL HIS LONG AND LOVELY LIFEFORTUNATE TO HIS LATEST
MOMENT THE REPORTERS SAID THERE WERE TEARS OF SORROW IN MY EYES
TRUEBUT THEY WERE FOR ME NOT FOR HIM HE HAD SUFFERED NO LOSS ALL
THE FORTUNES HE HAD EVER MADE BEFORE WERE POVERTY COMPARED WITH THIS
ONE

WHY DID I BUILD THIS HOUSE TWO YEARS AGO TO SHELTER THIS VAST
EMPTINESS HOW FOOLISH I WAS BUT I SHALL STAY IN IT THE SPIRITS OF
THE DEAD HALLOW A HOUSE FOR ME IT WAS NOT SO WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF MY
FAMILY SUSY DIED IN THE HOUSE WE BUILT IN HARTFORD MRS CLEMENS WOULD
NEVER ENTER IT AGAIN BUT IT MADE THE HOUSE DEARER TO ME I HAVE
ENTERED IT ONCE SINCE WHEN IT WAS TENANTLESS AND SILENT AND FORLORN
BUT TO ME IT WAS A HOLY PLACE AND BEAUTIFUL IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE
SPIRITS OF THE DEAD WERE ALL ABOUT ME AND WOULD SPEAK TO ME AND
WELCOME ME IF THEY COULD LIVY AND SUSY AND GEORGE AND HENRY
ROBINSON AND CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER HOW GOOD AND KIND THEY WERE AND
HOW LOVABLE THEIR LIVES IN FANCY I COULD SEE THEM ALL AGAIN I COULD
CALL THE CHILDREN BACK AND HEAR THEM ROMP AGAIN WITH GEORGETHAT
PEERLESS BLACK EXSLAVE AND CHILDRENS IDOL WHO CAME ONE DAYA FLITTING
STRANGERTO WASH WINDOWS AND STAYED EIGHTEEN YEARS UNTIL HE DIED
CLARA AND JEAN WOULD NEVER ENTER AGAIN THE NEW YORK HOTEL WHICH THEIR
MOTHER HAD FREQUENTED IN EARLIER DAYS THEY COULD NOT BEAR IT BUT I
SHALL STAY IN THIS HOUSE IT IS DEARER TO ME TONIGHT THAN EVER IT WAS
BEFORE JEANS SPIRIT WILL MAKE IT BEAUTIFUL FOR ME ALWAYS HER LONELY
AND TRAGIC DEATHBUT I WILL NOT THINK OF THAT NOW

JEANS MOTHER ALWAYS DEVOTED TWO OR THREE WEEKS TO CHRISTMAS SHOPPING
AND WAS ALWAYS PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTED WHEN CHRISTMAS EVE CAME JEAN WAS
HER VERY OWN CHILDSHE WORE HERSELF OUT PRESENTHUNTING IN NEW YORK
THESE LATTER DAYS PAINE HAS JUST FOUND ON HER DESK A LONG LIST OF
NAMESFIFTY HE THINKSPEOPLE TO WHOM SHE SENT PRESENTS LAST NIGHT
APPARENTLY SHE FORGOT NO ONE AND KATY FOUND THERE A ROLL OF
BANKNOTES FOR THE SERVANTS

HER DOG HAS BEEN WANDERING ABOUT THE GROUNDS TODAY COMRADELESS AND
FORLORN I HAVE SEEN HIM FROM THE WINDOWS SHE GOT HIM FROM GERMANY HE
HAS TALL EARS AND LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE A WOLF HE WAS EDUCATED IN
GERMANY AND KNOWS NO LANGUAGE BUT THE GERMAN JEAN GAVE HIM NO ORDERS
SAVE IN THAT TONGUE AND SO WHEN THE BURGLARALARM MADE A FIERCE CLAMOR
AT MIDNIGHT A FORTNIGHT AGO THE BUTLER WHO IS FRENCH AND KNOWS NO
GERMAN TRIED IN VAIN TO INTEREST THE DOG IN THE SUPPOSED BURGLAR JEAN
WROTE ME TO BERMUDA ABOUT THE INCIDENT IT WAS THE LAST LETTER I WAS
EVER TO RECEIVE FROM HER BRIGHT HEAD AND HER COMPETENT HAND THE DOG
WILL NOT BE NEGLECTED

THERE WAS NEVER A KINDER HEART THAN JEANS FROM HER CHILDHOOD UP SHE
ALWAYS SPENT THE MOST OF HER ALLOWANCE ON CHARITIES OF ONE KIND AND
ANOTHER AFTER SHE BECAME SECRETARY AND HAD HER INCOME DOUBLED SHE
SPENT HER MONEY UPON THESE THINGS WITH A FREE HAND MINE TOO I AM GLAD
AND GRATEFUL TO SAY

SHE WAS A LOYAL FRIEND TO ALL ANIMALS AND SHE LOVED THEM ALL BIRDS
BEASTS AND EVERYTHINGEVEN SNAKESAN INHERITANCE FROM ME SHE KNEW ALL
THE BIRDS SHE WAS HIGH UP IN THAT LORE SHE BECAME A MEMBER OF VARIOUS
HUMANE SOCIETIES WHEN SHE WAS STILL A LITTLE GIRLBOTH HERE AND
ABROADAND SHE REMAINED AN ACTIVE MEMBER TO THE LAST SHE FOUNDED TWO
OR THREE SOCIETIES FOR THE PROTECTION OF ANIMALS HERE AND IN EUROPE

SHE WAS AN EMBARRASSING SECRETARY FOR SHE FISHED MY CORRESPONDENCE OUT
OF THE WASTEBASKET AND ANSWERED THE LETTERS SHE THOUGHT ALL LETTERS
DESERVED THE COURTESY OF AN ANSWER HER MOTHER BROUGHT HER UP IN THAT
KINDLY ERROR

SHE COULD WRITE A GOOD LETTER AND WAS SWIFT WITH HER PEN SHE HAD BUT
AN INDIFFERENT EAR FOR MUSIC BUT HER TONGUE TOOK TO LANGUAGES WITH AN
EASY FACILITY SHE NEVER ALLOWED HER ITALIAN FRENCH AND GERMAN TO GET
RUSTY THROUGH NEGLECT

THE TELEGRAMS OF SYMPATHY ARE FLOWING IN FROM FAR AND WIDE NOW JUST
AS THEY DID IN ITALY FIVE YEARS AND A HALF AGO WHEN THIS CHILDS
MOTHER LAID DOWN HER BLAMELESS LIFE THEY CANNOT HEAL THE HURT BUT
THEY TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE PAIN WHEN JEAN AND I KISSED HANDS AND
PARTED AT MY DOOR LAST HOW LITTLE DID WE IMAGINE THAT IN TWENTYTWO
HOURS THE TELEGRAPH WOULD BE BRINGING WORDS LIKE THESE

FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS WE SEND OUR SYMPATHY DEAREST OF
FRIENDS

FOR MANY AND MANY A DAY TO COME WHEREVER I GO IN THIS HOUSE
REMEMBRANCERS OF JEAN WILL MUTELY SPEAK TO ME OF HER WHO CAN COUNT THE
NUMBER OF THEM

SHE WAS IN EXILE TWO YEARS WITH THE HOPE OF HEALING HER
MALADYEPILEPSY THERE ARE NO WORDS TO EXPRESS HOW GRATEFUL I AM THAT
SHE DID NOT MEET HER FATE IN THE HANDS OF STRANGERS BUT IN THE LOVING
SHELTER OF HER OWN HOME

MISS JEAN IS DEAD

IT IS TRUE JEAN IS DEAD

A MONTH AGO I WAS WRITING BUBBLING AND HILARIOUS ARTICLES FOR MAGAZINES
YET TO APPEAR AND NOW I AM WRITINGTHIS

CHRISTMAS DAY NOONLAST NIGHT I WENT TO JEANS ROOM AT INTERVALS AND
TURNED BACK THE SHEET AND LOOKED AT THE PEACEFUL FACE AND KISSED THE
COLD BROW AND REMEMBERED THAT HEARTBREAKING NIGHT IN FLORENCE SO LONG
AGO IN THAT CAVERNOUS AND SILENT VAST VILLA WHEN I CREPT DOWNSTAIRS
SO MANY TIMES AND TURNED BACK A SHEET AND LOOKED AT A FACE JUST LIKE
THIS ONEJEANS MOTHERS FACEAND KISSED A BROW THAT WAS JUST LIKE THIS
ONE AND LAST NIGHT I SAW AGAIN WHAT I HAD SEEN THENTHAT STRANGE AND
LOVELY MIRACLETHE SWEET SOFT CONTOURS OF EARLY MAIDENHOOD RESTORED BY
THE GRACIOUS HAND OF DEATH WHEN JEANS MOTHER LAY DEAD ALL TRACE OF
CARE AND TROUBLE AND SUFFERING AND THE CORRODING YEARS HAD VANISHED
OUT OF THE FACE AND I WAS LOOKING AGAIN UPON IT AS I HAD KNOWN AND
WORSHIPED IT IN ITS YOUNG BLOOM AND BEAUTY A WHOLE GENERATION BEFORE

ABOUT THREE IN THE MORNING WHILE WANDERING ABOUT THE HOUSE IN THE DEEP
SILENCES AS ONE DOES IN TIMES LIKE THESE WHEN THERE IS A DUMB SENSE
THAT SOMETHING HAS BEEN LOST THAT WILL NEVER BE FOUND AGAIN YET MUST
BE SOUGHT IF ONLY FOR THE EMPLOYMENT THE USELESS SEEKING GIVES I CAME
UPON JEANS DOG IN THE HALL DOWNSTAIRS AND NOTED THAT HE DID NOT
SPRING TO GREET ME ACCORDING TO HIS HOSPITABLE HABIT BUT CAME SLOW
AND SORROWFULLY ALSO I REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD NOT VISITED JEANS
APARTMENT SINCE THE TRAGEDY POOR FELLOW DID HE KNOW I THINK SO
ALWAYS WHEN JEAN WAS ABROAD IN THE OPEN HE WAS WITH HER ALWAYS WHEN
SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE HE WAS WITH HER IN THE NIGHT AS WELL AS IN THE
DAY HER PARLOR WAS HIS BEDROOM WHENEVER I HAPPENED UPON HIM ON THE
GROUND FLOOR HE ALWAYS FOLLOWED ME ABOUT AND WHEN I WENT UPSTAIRS HE
WENT TOOIN A TUMULTUOUS GALLOP BUT NOW IT WAS DIFFERENT AFTER
PATTING HIM A LITTLE I WENT TO THE LIBRARYHE REMAINED BEHIND WHEN I
WENT UPSTAIRS HE DID NOT FOLLOW ME SAVE WITH HIS WISTFUL EYES HE HAS
WONDERFUL EYESBIG AND KIND AND ELOQUENT HE CAN TALK WITH THEM HE
IS A BEAUTIFUL CREATURE AND IS OF THE BREED OF THE NEW YORK
POLICEDOGS I DO NOT LIKE DOGS BECAUSE THEY BARK WHEN THERE IS NO
OCCASION FOR IT BUT I HAVE LIKED THIS ONE FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE
HE BELONGED TO JEAN AND BECAUSE HE NEVER BARKS EXCEPT WHEN THERE IS
OCCASIONWHICH IS NOT OFTENER THAN TWICE A WEEK

IN MY WANDERINGS I VISITED JEANS PARLOR ON A SHELF I FOUND A PILE OF
MY BOOKS AND I KNEW WHAT IT MEANT SHE WAS WAITING FOR ME TO COME HOME
FROM BERMUDA AND AUTOGRAPH THEM THEN SHE WOULD SEND THEM AWAY IF I
ONLY KNEW WHOM SHE INTENDED THEM FOR BUT I SHALL NEVER KNOW I WILL
KEEP THEM HER HAND HAS TOUCHED THEMIT IS AN ACCOLADETHEY ARE NOBLE
NOW

AND IN A CLOSET SHE HAD HIDDEN A SURPRISE FOR MEA THING I HAVE OFTEN
WISHED I OWNED A NOBLE BIG GLOBE I COULDNT SEE IT FOR THE TEARS SHE
WILL NEVER KNOW THE PRIDE I TAKE IN IT AND THE PLEASURE TODAY THE
MAILS ARE FULL OF LOVING REMEMBRANCES FOR HER FULL OF THOSE OLD OLD
KIND WORDS SHE LOVED SO WELL MERRY CHRISTMAS TO JEAN IF SHE COULD
ONLY HAVE LIVED ONE DAY LONGER

AT LAST SHE RAN OUT OF MONEY AND WOULD NOT USE MINE SO SHE SENT TO
ONE OF THOSE NEW YORK HOMES FOR POOR GIRLS ALL THE CLOTHES SHE COULD
SPAREAND MORE MOST LIKELY

CHRISTMAS NIGHTTHIS AFTERNOON THEY TOOK HER AWAY FROM HER ROOM AS
SOON AS I MIGHT I WENT DOWN TO THE LIBRARY AND THERE SHE LAY IN HER
COFFIN DRESSED IN EXACTLY THE SAME CLOTHES SHE WORE WHEN SHE STOOD AT
THE OTHER END OF THE SAME ROOM ON THE TH OF OCTOBER LAST AS CLARAS
CHIEF BRIDESMAID HER FACE WAS RADIANT WITH HAPPY EXCITEMENT THEN IT
WAS THE SAME FACE NOW WITH THE DIGNITY OF DEATH AND THE PEACE OF GOD
UPON IT

THEY TOLD ME THE FIRST MOURNER TO COME WAS THE DOG HE CAME UNINVITED
AND STOOD UP ON HIS HIND LEGS AND RESTED HIS FORE PAWS UPON THE
TRESTLE AND TOOK A LAST LONG LOOK AT THE FACE THAT WAS SO DEAR TO HIM
THEN WENT HIS WAY AS SILENTLY AS HE HAD COME HE KNOWS

AT MIDAFTERNOON IT BEGAN TO SNOW THE PITY OF ITTHAT JEAN COULD NOT
SEE IT SHE SO LOVED THE SNOW

THE SNOW CONTINUED TO FALL AT SIX OCLOCK THE HEARSE DREW UP TO THE
DOOR TO BEAR AWAY ITS PATHETIC BURDEN AS THEY LIFTED THE CASKET PAINE
BEGAN PLAYING ON THE ORCHESTRELLE SCHUBERTS IMPROMPTU WHICH WAS
JEANS FAVORITE THEN HE PLAYED THE INTERMEZZO THAT WAS FOR SUSY THEN
HE PLAYED THE LARGO THAT WAS FOR THEIR MOTHER HE DID THIS AT MY
REQUEST ELSEWHERE IN MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY I HAVE TOLD HOW THE INTERMEZZO
AND THE LARGO CAME TO BE ASSOCIATED IN MY HEART WITH SUSY AND LIVY IN
THEIR LAST HOURS IN THIS LIFE

FROM MY WINDOWS I SAW THE HEARSE AND THE CARRIAGES WIND ALONG THE ROAD
AND GRADUALLY GROW VAGUE AND SPECTRAL IN THE FALLING SNOW AND
PRESENTLY DISAPPEAR JEAN WAS GONE OUT OF MY LIFE AND WOULD NOT COME
BACK ANY MORE JERVIS THE COUSIN SHE HAD PLAYED WITH WHEN THEY WERE
BABIES TOGETHERHE AND HER BELOVED OLD KATYWERE CONDUCTING HER TO HER
DISTANT CHILDHOOD HOME WHERE SHE WILL LIE BY HER MOTHERS SIDE ONCE
MORE IN THE COMPANY OF SUSY AND LANGDON

DECEMBER TH THE DOG CAME TO SEE ME AT EIGHT OCLOCK THIS MORNING HE
WAS VERY AFFECTIONATE POOR ORPHAN MY ROOM WILL BE HIS QUARTERS
HEREAFTER

THE STORM RAGED ALL NIGHT IT HAS RAGED ALL THE MORNING THE SNOW
DRIVES ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE IN VAST CLOUDS SUPERB SUBLIMEAND JEAN
NOT HERE TO SEE

PMIT IS THE TIME APPOINTED THE FUNERAL HAS BEGUN FOUR HUNDRED
MILES AWAY BUT I CAN SEE IT ALL JUST AS IF I WERE THERE THE SCENE IS
THE LIBRARY IN THE LANGDON HOMESTEAD JEANS COFFIN STANDS WHERE HER
MOTHER AND I STOOD FORTY YEARS AGO AND WERE MARRIED AND WHERE SUSYS
COFFIN STOOD THIRTEEN YEARS AGO WHERE HER MOTHERS STOOD FIVE YEARS
AND A HALF AGO AND WHERE MINE WILL STAND AFTER A LITTLE TIME

FIVE OCLOCKIT IS ALL OVER

WHEN CLARA WENT AWAY TWO WEEKS AGO TO LIVE IN EUROPE IT WAS HARD BUT
I COULD BEAR IT FOR I HAD JEAN LEFT I SAID WE WOULD BE A FAMILY WE
SAID WE WOULD BE CLOSE COMRADES AND HAPPYJUST WE TWO THAT FAIR DREAM
WAS IN MY MIND WHEN JEAN MET ME AT THE STEAMER LAST MONDAY IT WAS IN
MY MIND WHEN SHE RECEIVED ME AT THE DOOR LAST TUESDAY EVENING WE WERE
TOGETHER WE WERE A FAMILY THE DREAM HAD COME TRUEOH PRECISELY TRUE
CONTENTEDLY TRUE SATISFYINGLY TRUE AND REMAINED TRUE TWO WHOLE DAYS

AND NOW NOW JEAN IS IN HER GRAVE

IN THE GRAVEIF I CAN BELIEVE IT GOD REST HER SWEET SPIRIT




THE TURNINGPOINT OF MY LIFE

I

IF I UNDERSTAND THE IDEA THE BAZAR INVITES SEVERAL OF US TO WRITE
UPON THE ABOVE TEXT IT MEANS THE CHANGE IN MY LIFES COURSE WHICH
INTRODUCED WHAT MUST BE REGARDED BY ME AS THE MOST IMPORTANT
CONDITION OF MY CAREER BUT IT ALSO IMPLIESWITHOUT INTENTION
PERHAPSTHAT THAT TURNINGPOINT ITSELF WAS THE CREATOR OF THE NEW
CONDITION THIS GIVES IT TOO MUCH DISTINCTION TOO MUCH PROMINENCE TOO
MUCH CREDIT IT IS ONLY THE LAST LINK IN A VERY LONG CHAIN OF
TURNINGPOINTS COMMISSIONED TO PRODUCE THE CARDINAL RESULT IT IS NOT
ANY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE HUMBLEST OF ITS TEN THOUSAND PREDECESSORS
EACH OF THE TEN THOUSAND DID ITS APPOINTED SHARE ON ITS APPOINTED
DATE IN FORWARDING THE SCHEME AND THEY WERE ALL NECESSARY TO HAVE
LEFT OUT ANY ONE OF THEM WOULD HAVE DEFEATED THE SCHEME AND BROUGHT
ABOUT SOME OTHER RESULT I KNOW WE HAVE A FASHION OF SAYING SUCH AND
SUCH AN EVENT WAS THE TURNINGPOINT IN MY LIFE BUT WE SHOULDNT SAY
IT WE SHOULD MERELY GRANT THAT ITS PLACE AS LAST LINK IN THE CHAIN
MAKES IT THE MOST CONSPICUOUS LINK IN REAL IMPORTANCE IT HAS NO
ADVANTAGE OVER ANY ONE OF ITS PREDECESSORS

PERHAPS THE MOST CELEBRATED TURNINGPOINT RECORDED IN HISTORY WAS THE
CROSSING OF THE RUBICON SUETONIUS SAYS

COMING UP WITH HIS TROOPS ON THE BANKS OF THE RUBICON HE HALTED FOR A
WHILE AND REVOLVING IN HIS MIND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STEP HE WAS ON
THE POINT OF TAKING HE TURNED TO THOSE ABOUT HIM AND SAID WE MAY
STILL RETREAT BUT IF WE PASS THIS LITTLE BRIDGE NOTHING IS LEFT FOR
US BUT TO FIGHT IT OUT IN ARMS

THIS WAS A STUPENDOUSLY IMPORTANT MOMENT AND ALL THE INCIDENTS BIG
AND LITTLE OF CAESARS PREVIOUS LIFE HAD BEEN LEADING UP TO IT STAGE
BY STAGE LINK BY LINK THIS WAS THE LAST LINKMERELY THE LAST ONE
AND NO BIGGER THAN THE OTHERS BUT AS WE GAZE BACK AT IT THROUGH THE
INFLATING MISTS OF OUR IMAGINATION IT LOOKS AS BIG AS THE ORBIT OF
NEPTUNE

YOU THE READER HAVE A PERSONAL INTEREST IN THAT LINK AND SO HAVE
I SO HAS THE REST OF THE HUMAN RACE IT WAS ONE OF THE LINKS IN YOUR
LIFECHAIN AND IT WAS ONE OF THE LINKS IN MINE WE MAY WAIT NOW WITH
BATED BREATH WHILE CAESAR REFLECTS YOUR FATE AND MINE ARE INVOLVED IN
HIS DECISION

WHILE HE WAS THUS HESITATING THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT OCCURRED A PERSON
REMARKED FOR HIS NOBLE MIEN AND GRACEFUL ASPECT APPEARED CLOSE AT HAND
SITTING AND PLAYING UPON A PIPE WHEN NOT ONLY THE SHEPHERDS BUT A
NUMBER OF SOLDIERS ALSO FLOCKED TO LISTEN TO HIM AND SOME TRUMPETERS
AMONG THEM HE SNATCHED A TRUMPET FROM ONE OF THEM RAN TO THE RIVER
WITH IT AND SOUNDING THE ADVANCE WITH A PIERCING BLAST CROSSED TO
THE OTHER SIDE UPON THIS CAESAR EXCLAIMED LET US GO WHITHER THE
OMENS OF THE GODS AND THE INIQUITY OF OUR ENEMIES CALL US THE DIE IS
CAST

SO HE CROSSEDAND CHANGED THE FUTURE OF THE WHOLE HUMAN RACE FOR ALL
TIME BUT THAT STRANGER WAS A LINK IN CAESARS LIFECHAIN TOO AND A
NECESSARY ONE WE DONT KNOW HIS NAME WE NEVER HEAR OF HIM AGAIN HE
WAS VERY CASUAL HE ACTS LIKE AN ACCIDENT BUT HE WAS NO ACCIDENT HE
WAS THERE BY COMPULSION OF HIS LIFECHAIN TO BLOW THE ELECTRIFYING
BLAST THAT WAS TO MAKE UP CAESARS MIND FOR HIM AND THENCE GO PIPING
DOWN THE AISLES OF HISTORY FOREVER

IF THE STRANGER HADNT BEEN THERE BUT HE WAS AND CAESAR CROSSED WITH
SUCH RESULTS SUCH VAST EVENTSEACH A LINK IN THE HUMAN RACES
LIFECHAIN EACH EVENT PRODUCING THE NEXT ONE AND THAT ONE THE NEXT
ONE AND SO ON THE DESTRUCTION OF THE REPUBLIC THE FOUNDING OF THE
EMPIRE THE BREAKING UP OF THE EMPIRE THE RISE OF CHRISTIANITY UPON
ITS RUINS THE SPREAD OF THE RELIGION TO OTHER LANDSAND SO ON LINK BY
LINK TOOK ITS APPOINTED PLACE AT ITS APPOINTED TIME THE DISCOVERY OF
AMERICA BEING ONE OF THEM OUR REVOLUTION ANOTHER THE INFLOW OF
ENGLISH AND OTHER IMMIGRANTS ANOTHER THEIR DRIFT WESTWARD MY
ANCESTORS AMONG THEM ANOTHER THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN OF THEM IN
MISSOURI WHICH RESULTED IN ME FOR I WAS ONE OF THE UNAVOIDABLE
RESULTS OF THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON IF THE STRANGER WITH HIS
TRUMPET BLAST HAD STAYED AWAY WHICH HE COULDNT FOR HE WAS AN
APPOINTED LINK CAESAR WOULD NOT HAVE CROSSED WHAT WOULD HAVE
HAPPENED IN THAT CASE WE CAN NEVER GUESS WE ONLY KNOW THAT THE
THINGS THAT DID HAPPEN WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN
REPLACED BY EQUALLY PRODIGIOUS THINGS OF COURSE BUT THEIR NATURE AND
RESULTS ARE BEYOND OUR GUESSING BUT THE MATTER THAT INTERESTS ME
PERSONALLY IS THAT I WOULD NOT BE HERE NOW BUT SOMEWHERE ELSE AND
PROBABLY BLACKTHERE IS NO TELLING VERY WELL I AM GLAD HE CROSSED
AND VERY REALLY AND THANKFULLY GLAD TOO THOUGH I NEVER CARED ANYTHING
ABOUT IT BEFORE

II

TO ME THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE OF MY LIFE IS ITS LITERARY FEATURE I
HAVE BEEN PROFESSIONALLY LITERARY SOMETHING MORE THAN FORTY YEARS
THERE HAVE BEEN MANY TURNINGPOINTS IN MY LIFE BUT THE ONE THAT WAS
THE LAST LINK IN THE CHAIN APPOINTED TO CONDUCT ME TO THE LITERARY
GUILD IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS LINK IN THAT CHAIN BECAUSE IT WAS
THE LAST ONE IT WAS NOT ANY MORE IMPORTANT THAN ITS PREDECESSORS ALL
THE OTHER LINKS HAVE AN INCONSPICUOUS LOOK EXCEPT THE CROSSING OF THE
RUBICON BUT AS FACTORS IN MAKING ME LITERARY THEY ARE ALL OF THE ONE
SIZE THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON INCLUDED

I KNOW HOW I CAME TO BE LITERARY AND I WILL TELL THE STEPS THAT LEAD
UP TO IT AND BROUGHT IT ABOUT

THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON WAS NOT THE FIRST ONE IT WAS HARDLY EVEN A
RECENT ONE I SHOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AGES BEFORE CAESARS DAY TO FIND
THE FIRST ONE TO SAVE SPACE I WILL GO BACK ONLY A COUPLE OF
GENERATIONS AND START WITH AN INCIDENT OF MY BOYHOOD WHEN I WAS TWELVE
AND A HALF YEARS OLD MY FATHER DIED IT WAS IN THE SPRING THE SUMMER
CAME AND BROUGHT WITH IT AN EPIDEMIC OF MEASLES FOR A TIME A CHILD
DIED ALMOST EVERY DAY THE VILLAGE WAS PARALYZED WITH FRIGHT DISTRESS
DESPAIR CHILDREN THAT WERE NOT SMITTEN WITH THE DISEASE WERE
IMPRISONED IN THEIR HOMES TO SAVE THEM FROM THE INFECTION IN THE HOMES
THERE WERE NO CHEERFUL FACES THERE WAS NO MUSIC THERE WAS NO SINGING
BUT OF SOLEMN HYMNS NO VOICE BUT OF PRAYER NO ROMPING WAS ALLOWED NO
NOISE NO LAUGHTER THE FAMILY MOVED SPECTRALLY ABOUT ON TIPTOE IN A
GHOSTLY HUSH I WAS A PRISONER MY SOUL WAS STEEPED IN THIS AWFUL
DREARINESSAND IN FEAR AT SOME TIME OR OTHER EVERY DAY AND EVERY NIGHT
A SUDDEN SHIVER SHOOK ME TO THE MARROW AND I SAID TO MYSELF THERE
IVE GOT IT AND I SHALL DIE LIFE ON THESE MISERABLE TERMS WAS NOT
WORTH LIVING AND AT LAST I MADE UP MY MIND TO GET THE DISEASE AND HAVE
IT OVER ONE WAY OR THE OTHER I ESCAPED FROM THE HOUSE AND WENT TO THE
HOUSE OF A NEIGHBOR WHERE A PLAYMATE OF MINE WAS VERY ILL WITH THE
MALADY WHEN THE CHANCE OFFERED I CREPT INTO HIS ROOM AND GOT INTO BED
WITH HIM I WAS DISCOVERED BY HIS MOTHER AND SENT BACK INTO CAPTIVITY
BUT I HAD THE DISEASE THEY COULD NOT TAKE THAT FROM ME I CAME NEAR TO
DYING THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS INTERESTED AND ANXIOUS AND SENT FOR NEWS
OF ME EVERY DAY AND NOT ONLY ONCE A DAY BUT SEVERAL TIMES EVERYBODY
BELIEVED I WOULD DIE BUT ON THE FOURTEENTH DAY A CHANGE CAME FOR THE
WORSE AND THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED

THIS WAS A TURNINGPOINT OF MY LIFE LINK NUMBER ONE FOR WHEN I GOT
WELL MY MOTHER CLOSED MY SCHOOL CAREER AND APPRENTICED ME TO A PRINTER
SHE WAS TIRED OF TRYING TO KEEP ME OUT OF MISCHIEF AND THE ADVENTURE
OF THE MEASLES DECIDED HER TO PUT ME INTO MORE MASTERFUL HANDS THAN
HERS

I BECAME A PRINTER AND BEGAN TO ADD ONE LINK AFTER ANOTHER TO THE
CHAIN WHICH WAS TO LEAD ME INTO THE LITERARY PROFESSION A LONG ROAD
BUT I COULD NOT KNOW THAT AND AS I DID NOT KNOW WHAT ITS GOAL WAS OR
EVEN THAT IT HAD ONE I WAS INDIFFERENT ALSO CONTENTED

A YOUNG PRINTER WANDERS AROUND A GOOD DEAL SEEKING AND FINDING WORK
AND SEEKING AGAIN WHEN NECESSITY COMMANDS N B NECESSITY IS A
CIRCUMSTANCE CIRCUMSTANCE IS MANS MASTERAND WHEN CIRCUMSTANCE
COMMANDS HE MUST OBEY HE MAY ARGUE THE MATTERTHAT IS HIS PRIVILEGE
JUST AS IT IS THE HONORABLE PRIVILEGE OF A FALLING BODY TO ARGUE WITH
THE ATTRACTION OF GRAVITATIONBUT IT WONT DO ANY GOOD HE MUST OBEY I
WANDERED FOR TEN YEARS UNDER THE GUIDANCE AND DICTATORSHIP OF
CIRCUMSTANCE AND FINALLY ARRIVED IN A CITY OF IOWA WHERE I WORKED
SEVERAL MONTHS AMONG THE BOOKS THAT INTERESTED ME IN THOSE DAYS WAS
ONE ABOUT THE AMAZON THE TRAVELER TOLD AN ALLURING TALE OF HIS LONG
VOYAGE UP THE GREAT RIVER FROM PARA TO THE SOURCES OF THE MADEIRA
THROUGH THE HEART OF AN ENCHANTED LAND A LAND WASTEFULLY RICH IN
TROPICAL WONDERS A ROMANTIC LAND WHERE ALL THE BIRDS AND FLOWERS AND
ANIMALS WERE OF THE MUSEUM VARIETIES AND WHERE THE ALLIGATOR AND THE
CROCODILE AND THE MONKEY SEEMED AS MUCH AT HOME AS IF THEY WERE IN THE
ZOO ALSO HE TOLD AN ASTONISHING TALE ABOUT COCA A VEGETABLE PRODUCT
OF MIRACULOUS POWERS ASSERTING THAT IT WAS SO NOURISHING AND SO
STRENGTHGIVING THAT THE NATIVE OF THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MADEIRA REGION
WOULD TRAMP UP HILL AND DOWN ALL DAY ON A PINCH OF POWDERED COCA AND
REQUIRE NO OTHER SUSTENANCE

I WAS FIRED WITH A LONGING TO ASCEND THE AMAZON ALSO WITH A LONGING TO
OPEN UP A TRADE IN COCA WITH ALL THE WORLD DURING MONTHS I DREAMED
THAT DREAM AND TRIED TO CONTRIVE WAYS TO GET TO PARA AND SPRING THAT
SPLENDID ENTERPRISE UPON AN UNSUSPECTING PLANET BUT ALL IN VAIN A
PERSON MAY PLAN AS MUCH AS HE WANTS TO BUT NOTHING OF CONSEQUENCE IS
LIKELY TO COME OF IT UNTIL THE MAGICIAN CIRCUMSTANCE STEPS IN AND
TAKES THE MATTER OFF HIS HANDS AT LAST CIRCUMSTANCE CAME TO MY HELP
IT WAS IN THIS WAY CIRCUMSTANCE TO HELP OR HURT ANOTHER MAN MADE HIM
LOSE A FIFTYDOLLAR BILL IN THE STREET AND TO HELP OR HURT ME MADE ME
FIND IT I ADVERTISED THE FIND AND LEFT FOR THE AMAZON THE SAME DAY
THIS WAS ANOTHER TURNINGPOINT ANOTHER LINK

COULD CIRCUMSTANCE HAVE ORDERED ANOTHER DWELLER IN THAT TOWN TO GO TO
THE AMAZON AND OPEN UP A WORLDTRADE IN COCA ON A FIFTYDOLLAR BASIS
AND BEEN OBEYED NO I WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE WERE OTHER FOOLS
THERESHOALS AND SHOALS OF THEMBUT THEY WERE NOT OF MY KIND I WAS THE
ONLY ONE OF MY KIND

CIRCUMSTANCE IS POWERFUL BUT IT CANNOT WORK ALONE IT HAS TO HAVE A
PARTNER ITS PARTNER IS MANS TEMPERAMENTHIS NATURAL DISPOSITION
HIS TEMPERAMENT IS NOT HIS INVENTION IT IS BORN IN HIM AND HE HAS
NO AUTHORITY OVER IT NEITHER IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS ACTS HE CANNOT
CHANGE IT NOTHING CAN CHANGE IT NOTHING CAN MODIFY ITEXCEPT
TEMPORARILY BUT IT WONT STAY MODIFIED IT IS PERMANENT LIKE THE
COLOR OF THE MANS EYES AND THE SHAPE OF HIS EARS BLUE EYES ARE GRAY
IN CERTAIN UNUSUAL LIGHTS BUT THEY RESUME THEIR NATURAL COLOR WHEN
THAT STRESS IS REMOVED

A CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WILL COERCE ONE MAN WILL HAVE NO EFFECT UPON A MAN
OF A DIFFERENT TEMPERAMENT IF CIRCUMSTANCE HAD THROWN THE BANKNOTE IN
CAESARS WAY HIS TEMPERAMENT WOULD NOT HAVE MADE HIM START FOR THE
AMAZON HIS TEMPERAMENT WOULD HAVE COMPELLED HIM TO DO SOMETHING WITH
THE MONEY BUT NOT THAT IT MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM ADVERTISE THE NOTEAND
WAIT WE CANT TELL ALSO IT MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM GO TO NEW YORK AND
BUY INTO THE GOVERNMENT WITH RESULTS THAT WOULD LEAVE TWEED NOTHING TO
LEARN WHEN IT CAME HIS TURN

VERY WELL CIRCUMSTANCE FURNISHED THE CAPITAL AND MY TEMPERAMENT TOLD
ME WHAT TO DO WITH IT SOMETIMES A TEMPERAMENT IS AN ASS WHEN THAT IS
THE CASE THE OWNER OF IT IS AN ASS TOO AND IS GOING TO REMAIN ONE
TRAINING EXPERIENCE ASSOCIATION CAN TEMPORARILY SO POLISH HIM
IMPROVE HIM EXALT HIM THAT PEOPLE WILL THINK HE IS A MULE BUT THEY
WILL BE MISTAKEN ARTIFICIALLY HE IS A MULE FOR THE TIME BEING BUT AT
BOTTOM HE IS AN ASS YET AND WILL REMAIN ONE

BY TEMPERAMENT I WAS THE KIND OF PERSON THAT DOES THINGS DOES THEM
AND REFLECTS AFTERWARD SO I STARTED FOR THE AMAZON WITHOUT REFLECTING
AND WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTIONS THAT WAS MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS AGO
IN ALL THAT TIME MY TEMPERAMENT HAS NOT CHANGED BY EVEN A SHADE I
HAVE BEEN PUNISHED MANY AND MANY A TIME AND BITTERLY FOR DOING THINGS
AND REFLECTING AFTERWARD BUT THESE TORTURES HAVE BEEN OF NO VALUE TO
ME I STILL DO THE THING COMMANDED BY CIRCUMSTANCE AND TEMPERAMENT AND
REFLECT AFTERWARD ALWAYS VIOLENTLY WHEN I AM REFLECTING ON THOSE
OCCASIONS EVEN DEAF PERSONS CAN HEAR ME THINK

I WENT BY THE WAY OF CINCINNATI AND DOWN THE OHIO AND MISSISSIPPI MY
IDEA WAS TO TAKE SHIP AT NEW ORLEANS FOR PARA IN NEW ORLEANS I
INQUIRED AND FOUND THERE WAS NO SHIP LEAVING FOR PARA ALSO THAT
THERE NEVER HAD BEEN ONE LEAVING FOR PARA I REFLECTED A POLICEMAN
CAME AND ASKED ME WHAT I WAS DOING AND I TOLD HIM HE MADE ME MOVE ON
AND SAID IF HE CAUGHT ME REFLECTING IN THE PUBLIC STREET AGAIN HE WOULD
RUN ME IN

AFTER A FEW DAYS I WAS OUT OF MONEY THEN CIRCUMSTANCE ARRIVED WITH
ANOTHER TURNINGPOINT OF MY LIFEA NEW LINK ON MY WAY DOWN I HAD MADE
THE ACQUAINTANCE OF A PILOT I BEGGED HIM TO TEACH ME THE RIVER AND HE
CONSENTED I BECAME A PILOT

BY AND BY CIRCUMSTANCE CAME AGAININTRODUCING THE CIVIL WAR THIS TIME
IN ORDER TO PUSH ME AHEAD ANOTHER STAGE OR TWO TOWARD THE LITERARY
PROFESSION THE BOATS STOPPED RUNNING MY LIVELIHOOD WAS GONE

CIRCUMSTANCE CAME TO THE RESCUE WITH A NEW TURNINGPOINT AND A FRESH
LINK MY BROTHER WAS APPOINTED SECRETARY TO THE NEW TERRITORY OF
NEVADA AND HE INVITED ME TO GO WITH HIM AND HELP HIM IN HIS OFFICE I
ACCEPTED

IN NEVADA CIRCUMSTANCE FURNISHED ME THE SILVER FEVER AND I WENT INTO
THE MINES TO MAKE A FORTUNE AS I SUPPOSED BUT THAT WAS NOT THE IDEA
THE IDEA WAS TO ADVANCE ME ANOTHER STEP TOWARD LITERATURE FOR
AMUSEMENT I SCRIBBLED THINGS FOR THE VIRGINIA CITY ENTERPRISE ONE
ISNT A PRINTER TEN YEARS WITHOUT SETTING UP ACRES OF GOOD AND BAD
LITERATURE AND LEARNINGUNCONSCIOUSLY AT FIRST CONSCIOUSLY LATERTO
DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE TWO WITHIN HIS MENTAL LIMITATIONS AND
MEANTIME HE IS UNCONSCIOUSLY ACQUIRING WHAT IS CALLED A STYLE ONE OF
MY EFFORTS ATTRACTED ATTENTION AND THE ENTERPRISE SENT FOR ME AND
PUT ME ON ITS STAFF

AND SO I BECAME A JOURNALISTANOTHER LINK BY AND BY CIRCUMSTANCE AND
THE SACRAMENTO UNION SENT ME TO THE SANDWICH ISLANDS FOR FIVE OR SIX
MONTHS TO WRITE UP SUGAR I DID IT AND THREW IN A GOOD DEAL OF
EXTRANEOUS MATTER THAT HADNT ANYTHING TO DO WITH SUGAR BUT IT WAS
THIS EXTRANEOUS MATTER THAT HELPED ME TO ANOTHER LINK

IT MADE ME NOTORIOUS AND SAN FRANCISCO INVITED ME TO LECTURE WHICH I
DID AND PROFITABLY I HAD LONG HAD A DESIRE TO TRAVEL AND SEE THE
WORLD AND NOW CIRCUMSTANCE HAD MOST KINDLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY HURLED ME
UPON THE PLATFORM AND FURNISHED ME THE MEANS SO I JOINED THE QUAKER
CITY EXCURSION

WHEN I RETURNED TO AMERICA CIRCUMSTANCE WAS WAITING ON THE PIERWITH
THE LAST LINKTHE CONSPICUOUS THE CONSUMMATING THE VICTORIOUS LINK
I WAS ASKED TO WRITE A BOOK AND I DID IT AND CALLED IT THE
INNOCENTS ABROAD THUS I BECAME AT LAST A MEMBER OF THE LITERARY
GUILD THAT WAS FORTYTWO YEARS AGO AND I HAVE BEEN A MEMBER EVER
SINCE LEAVING THE RUBICON INCIDENT AWAY BACK WHERE IT BELONGS I CAN
SAY WITH TRUTH THAT THE REASON I AM IN THE LITERARY PROFESSION IS
BECAUSE I HAD THE MEASLES WHEN I WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD

III

NOW WHAT INTERESTS ME AS REGARDS THESE DETAILS IS NOT THE DETAILS
THEMSELVES BUT THE FACT THAT NONE OF THEM WAS FORESEEN BY ME NONE OF
THEM WAS PLANNED BY ME I WAS THE AUTHOR OF NONE OF THEM CIRCUMSTANCE
WORKING IN HARNESS WITH MY TEMPERAMENT CREATED THEM ALL AND COMPELLED
THEM ALL I OFTEN OFFERED HELP AND WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS BUT IT
WAS REJECTEDAS A RULE UNCOURTEOUSLY I COULD NEVER PLAN A THING AND
GET IT TO COME OUT THE WAY I PLANNED IT IT CAME OUT SOME OTHER
WAYSOME WAY I HAD NOT COUNTED UPON

AND SO I DO NOT ADMIRE THE HUMAN BEINGAS AN INTELLECTUAL MARVELAS
MUCH AS I DID WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND GOT HIM OUT OF BOOKS AND DID NOT
KNOW HIM PERSONALLY WHEN I USED TO READ THAT SUCH AND SUCH A GENERAL
DID A CERTAIN BRILLIANT THING I BELIEVED IT WHEREAS IT WAS NOT SO
CIRCUMSTANCE DID IT BY HELP OF HIS TEMPERAMENT THE CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD
HAVE FAILED OF EFFECT WITH A GENERAL OF ANOTHER TEMPERAMENT HE MIGHT
SEE THE CHANCE BUT LOSE THE ADVANTAGE BY BEING BY NATURE TOO SLOW OR
TOO QUICK OR TOO DOUBTFUL ONCE GENERAL GRANT WAS ASKED A QUESTION
ABOUT A MATTER WHICH HAD BEEN MUCH DEBATED BY THE PUBLIC AND THE
NEWSPAPERS HE ANSWERED THE QUESTION WITHOUT ANY HESITANCY GENERAL
WHO PLANNED THE MARCH THROUGH GEORGIA THE ENEMY HE ADDED THAT THE
ENEMY USUALLY MAKES YOUR PLANS FOR YOU HE MEANT THAT THE ENEMY BY
NEGLECT OR THROUGH FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES LEAVES AN OPENING FOR YOU
AND YOU SEE YOUR CHANCE AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT

CIRCUMSTANCES DO THE PLANNING FOR US ALL NO DOUBT BY HELP OF OUR
TEMPERAMENTS I SEE NO GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WATCH
EXCEPT THAT THE MAN IS CONSCIOUS AND THE WATCH ISNT AND THE MAN TRIES
TO PLAN THINGS AND THE WATCH DOESNT THE WATCH DOESNT WIND ITSELF AND
DOESNT REGULATE ITSELFTHESE THINGS ARE DONE EXTERIORLY OUTSIDE
INFLUENCES OUTSIDE CIRCUMSTANCES WIND THE MAN AND REGULATE HIM LEFT
TO HIMSELF HE WOULDNT GET REGULATED AT ALL AND THE SORT OF TIME HE
WOULD KEEP WOULD NOT BE VALUABLE SOME RARE MEN ARE WONDERFUL WATCHES
WITH GOLD CASE COMPENSATION BALANCE AND ALL THOSE THINGS AND SOME
MEN ARE ONLY SIMPLE AND SWEET AND HUMBLE WATERBURYS I AM A WATERBURY
A WATERBURY OF THAT KIND SOME SAY

A NATION IS ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL MULTIPLIED IT MAKES PLANS AND
CIRCUMSTANCE COMES AND UPSETS THEMOR ENLARGES THEM SOME PATRIOTS
THROW THE TEA OVERBOARD SOME OTHER PATRIOTS DESTROY A BASTILLE THE
PLANS STOP THERE THEN CIRCUMSTANCE COMES IN QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY AND
TURNS THESE MODEST RIOTS INTO A REVOLUTION

AND THERE WAS POOR COLUMBUS HE ELABORATED A DEEP PLAN TO FIND A NEW
ROUTE TO AN OLD COUNTRY CIRCUMSTANCE REVISED HIS PLAN FOR HIM AND HE
FOUND A NEW WORLD AND HE GETS THE CREDIT OF IT TO THIS DAY HE
HADNT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT

NECESSARILY THE SCENE OF THE REAL TURNINGPOINT OF MY LIFE AND OF
YOURS WAS THE GARDEN OF EDEN IT WAS THERE THAT THE FIRST LINK WAS
FORGED OF THE CHAIN THAT WAS ULTIMATELY TO LEAD TO THE EMPTYING OF ME
INTO THE LITERARY GUILD ADAMS TEMPERAMENT WAS THE FIRST COMMAND THE
DEITY EVER ISSUED TO A HUMAN BEING ON THIS PLANET AND IT WAS THE ONLY
COMMAND ADAM WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO DISOBEY IT SAID BE WEAK BE
WATER BE CHARACTERLESS BE CHEAPLY PERSUADABLE THE LATTER COMMAND
TO LET THE FRUIT ALONE WAS CERTAIN TO BE DISOBEYED NOT BY ADAM
HIMSELF BUT BY HIS TEMPERAMENTWHICH HE DID NOT CREATE AND HAD NO
AUTHORITY OVER FOR THE TEMPERAMENT IS THE MAN THE THING TRICKED OUT
WITH CLOTHES AND NAMED MAN IS MERELY ITS SHADOW NOTHING MORE THE LAW
OF THE TIGERS TEMPERAMENT IS THOU SHALT KILL THE LAW OF THE SHEEPS
TEMPERAMENT IS THOU SHALT NOT KILL TO ISSUE LATER COMMANDS REQUIRING
THE TIGER TO LET THE FAT STRANGER ALONE AND REQUIRING THE SHEEP TO
IMBUE ITS HANDS IN THE BLOOD OF THE LION IS NOT WORTH WHILE FOR THOSE
COMMANDS CANT BE OBEYED THEY WOULD INVITE TO VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW
OF TEMPERAMENT WHICH IS SUPREME AND TAKES PRECEDENCE OF ALL OTHER
AUTHORITIES I CANNOT HELP FEELING DISAPPOINTED IN ADAM AND EVE THAT
IS IN THEIR TEMPERAMENTS NOT IN THEM POOR HELPLESS YOUNG
CREATURESAFFLICTED WITH TEMPERAMENTS MADE OUT OF BUTTER WHICH BUTTER
WAS COMMANDED TO GET INTO CONTACT WITH FIRE AND BE MELTED WHAT I
CANNOT HELP WISHING IS THAT ADAM AND EVE HAD BEEN POSTPONED AND
MARTIN LUTHER AND JOAN OF ARC PUT IN THEIR PLACETHAT SPLENDID PAIR
EQUIPPED WITH TEMPERAMENTS NOT MADE OF BUTTER BUT OF ASBESTOS BY
NEITHER SUGARY PERSUASIONS NOR BY HELL FIRE COULD SATAN HAVE BEGUILED
THEM TO EAT THE APPLE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN RESULTS INDEED YES
THE APPLE WOULD BE INTACT TODAY THERE WOULD BE NO HUMAN RACE THERE
WOULD BE NO YOU THERE WOULD BE NO ME AND THE OLD OLD CREATIONDAWN
SCHEME OF ULTIMATELY LAUNCHING ME INTO THE LITERARY GUILD WOULD HAVE
BEEN DEFEATED




HOW TO MAKE HISTORY DATES STICK


THESE CHAPTERS ARE FOR CHILDREN AND I SHALL TRY TO MAKE THE WORDS
LARGE ENOUGH TO COMMAND RESPECT IN THE HOPE THAT YOU ARE LISTENING
AND THAT YOU HAVE CONFIDENCE IN ME I WILL PROCEED DATES ARE DIFFICULT
THINGS TO ACQUIRE AND AFTER THEY ARE ACQUIRED IT IS DIFFICULT TO KEEP
THEM IN THE HEAD BUT THEY ARE VERY VALUABLE THEY ARE LIKE THE
CATTLEPENS OF A RANCHTHEY SHUT IN THE SEVERAL BRANDS OF HISTORICAL
CATTLE EACH WITHIN ITS OWN FENCE AND KEEP THEM FROM GETTING MIXED
TOGETHER DATES ARE HARD TO REMEMBER BECAUSE THEY CONSIST OF FIGURES
FIGURES ARE MONOTONOUSLY UNSTRIKING IN APPEARANCE AND THEY DONT TAKE
HOLD THEY FORM NO PICTURES AND SO THEY GIVE THE EYE NO CHANCE TO
HELP PICTURES ARE THE THING PICTURES CAN MAKE DATES STICK THEY CAN
MAKE NEARLY ANYTHING STICKPARTICULARLY IF YOU MAKE THE PICTURES
YOURSELF INDEED THAT IS THE GREAT POINTMAKE THE PICTURES
YOURSELF I KNOW ABOUT THIS FROM EXPERIENCE THIRTY YEARS AGO I WAS
DELIVERING A MEMORIZED LECTURE EVERY NIGHT AND EVERY NIGHT I HAD TO
HELP MYSELF WITH A PAGE OF NOTES TO KEEP FROM GETTING MYSELF MIXED THE
NOTES CONSISTED OF BEGINNINGS OF SENTENCES AND WERE ELEVEN IN NUMBER
AND THEY RAN SOMETHING LIKE THIS

IN THAT REGION THE WEATHER

AT THAT TIME IT WAS A CUSTOM

BUT IN CALIFORNIA ONE NEVER HEARD

ELEVEN OF THEM THEY INITIALED THE BRIEF DIVISIONS OF THE LECTURE AND
PROTECTED ME AGAINST SKIPPING BUT THEY ALL LOOKED ABOUT ALIKE ON THE
PAGE THEY FORMED NO PICTURE I HAD THEM BY HEART BUT I COULD NEVER
WITH CERTAINTY REMEMBER THE ORDER OF THEIR SUCCESSION THEREFORE I
ALWAYS HAD TO KEEP THOSE NOTES BY ME AND LOOK AT THEM EVERY LITTLE
WHILE ONCE I MISLAID THEM YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO IMAGINE THE TERRORS
OF THAT EVENING I NOW SAW THAT I MUST INVENT SOME OTHER PROTECTION SO
I GOT TEN OF THE INITIAL LETTERS BY HEART IN THEIR PROPER ORDERI A
B AND SO ONAND I WENT ON THE PLATFORM THE NEXT NIGHT WITH THESE
MARKED IN INK ON MY TEN FINGERNAILS BUT IT DIDNT ANSWER I KEPT
TRACK OF THE FINGERS FOR A WHILE THEN I LOST IT AND AFTER THAT I WAS
NEVER QUITE SURE WHICH FINGER I HAD USED LAST I COULDNT LICK OFF A
LETTER AFTER USING IT FOR WHILE THEY COULD HAVE MADE SUCCESS CERTAIN
IT WOULD ALSO HAVE PROVOKED TOO MUCH CURIOSITY THERE WAS CURIOSITY
ENOUGH WITHOUT THAT TO THE AUDIENCE I SEEMED MORE INTERESTED IN MY
FINGERNAILS THAN I WAS IN MY SUBJECT ONE OR TWO PERSONS ASKED ME
AFTERWARD WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH MY HANDS

IT WAS NOW THAT THE IDEA OF PICTURES OCCURRED TO ME THEN MY TROUBLES
PASSED AWAY IN TWO MINUTES I MADE SIX PICTURES WITH A PEN AND THEY
DID THE WORK OF THE ELEVEN CATCHSENTENCES AND DID IT PERFECTLY I
THREW THE PICTURES AWAY AS SOON AS THEY WERE MADE FOR I WAS SURE I
COULD SHUT MY EYES AND SEE THEM ANY TIME THAT WAS A QUARTER OF A
CENTURY AGO THE LECTURE VANISHED OUT OF MY HEAD MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS
AGO BUT I COULD REWRITE IT FROM THE PICTURESFOR THEY REMAIN HERE ARE
THREE OF THEM FIG

THE FIRST ONE IS A HAYSTACKBELOW IT A RATTLESNAKEAND IT TOLD ME WHERE
TO BEGIN TO TALK RANCHLIFE IN CARSON VALLEY THE SECOND ONE TOLD ME
WHERE TO BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT A STRANGE AND VIOLENT WIND THAT USED TO
BURST UPON CARSON CITY FROM THE SIERRA NEVADAS EVERY AFTERNOON AT TWO
OCLOCK AND TRY TO BLOW THE TOWN AWAY THE THIRD PICTURE AS YOU EASILY
PERCEIVE IS LIGHTNING ITS DUTY WAS TO REMIND ME WHEN IT WAS TIME TO
BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO WEATHER WHERE THERE IS NO
LIGHTNINGNOR THUNDER EITHERAND IT NEVER FAILED ME

I WILL GIVE YOU A VALUABLE HINT WHEN A MAN IS MAKING A SPEECH AND YOU
ARE TO FOLLOW HIM DONT JOT DOWN NOTES TO SPEAK FROM JOT DOWN
PICTURES IT IS AWKWARD AND EMBARRASSING TO HAVE TO KEEP REFERRING TO
NOTES AND BESIDES IT BREAKS UP YOUR SPEECH AND MAKES IT RAGGED AND
NONCOHERENT BUT YOU CAN TEAR UP YOUR PICTURES AS SOON AS YOU HAVE
MADE THEMTHEY WILL STAY FRESH AND STRONG IN YOUR MEMORY IN THE ORDER
AND SEQUENCE IN WHICH YOU SCRATCHED THEM DOWN AND MANY WILL ADMIRE TO
SEE WHAT A GOOD MEMORY YOU ARE FURNISHED WITH WHEN PERHAPS YOUR MEMORY
IS NOT ANY BETTER THAN MINE

SIXTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE LITTLE CREATURES THE GOVERNESS
WAS TRYING TO HAMMER SOME PRIMER HISTORIES INTO THEIR HEADS PART OF
THIS FUNIF YOU LIKE TO CALL IT THATCONSISTED IN THE MEMORIZING OF
THE ACCESSION DATES OF THE THIRTYSEVEN PERSONAGES WHO HAD RULED OVER
ENGLAND FROM THE CONQUEROR DOWN THESE LITTLE PEOPLE FOUND IT A BITTER
HARD CONTRACT IT WAS ALL DATES THEY ALL LOOKED ALIKE AND THEY
WOULDNT STICK DAY AFTER DAY OF THE SUMMER VACATION DRIBBLED BY AND
STILL THE KINGS HELD THE FORT THE CHILDREN COULDNT CONQUER ANY SIX OF
THEM

WITH MY LECTURE EXPERIENCE IN MIND I WAS AWARE THAT I COULD INVENT SOME
WAY OUT OF THE TROUBLE WITH PICTURES BUT I HOPED A WAY COULD BE FOUND
WHICH WOULD LET THEM ROMP IN THE OPEN AIR WHILE THEY LEARNED THE KINGS
I FOUND IT AND THEN THEY MASTERED ALL THE MONARCHS IN A DAY OR TWO

THE IDEA WAS TO MAKE THEM SEE THE REIGNS WITH THEIR EYES THAT WOULD
BE A LARGE HELP WE WERE AT THE FARM THEN FROM THE HOUSEPORCH THE
GROUNDS SLOPED GRADUALLY DOWN TO THE LOWER FENCE AND ROSE ON THE RIGHT
TO THE HIGH GROUND WHERE MY SMALL WORKDEN STOOD A CARRIAGEROAD WOUND
THROUGH THE GROUNDS AND UP THE HILL I STAKED IT OUT WITH THE ENGLISH
MONARCHS BEGINNING WITH THE CONQUEROR AND YOU COULD STAND ON THE
PORCH AND CLEARLY SEE EVERY REIGN AND ITS LENGTH FROM THE CONQUEST
DOWN TO VICTORIA THEN IN THE FORTYSIXTH YEAR OF HER REIGNEIGHT
HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN YEARS OF ENGLISH HISTORY UNDER YOUR EYE AT ONCE

ENGLISH HISTORY WAS AN UNUSUALLY LIVE TOPIC IN AMERICA JUST THEN THE
WORLD HAD SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT WHILE IT WAS NOT NOTICING THE QUEEN
HAD PASSED HENRY VIII PASSED HENRY VI AND ELIZABETH AND GAINING IN
LENGTH EVERY DAY HER REIGN HAD ENTERED THE LIST OF THE LONG ONES
EVERYBODY WAS INTERESTED NOWIT WAS WATCHING A RACE WOULD SHE PASS THE
LONG EDWARD THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY OF IT WOULD SHE PASS THE LONG
HENRY DOUBTFUL MOST PEOPLE SAID THE LONG GEORGE IMPOSSIBLE
EVERYBODY SAID IT BUT WE HAVE LIVED TO SEE HER LEAVE HIM TWO YEARS
BEHIND

I MEASURED OFF FEET OF THE ROADWAY A FOOT REPRESENTING A YEAR AND
AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF EACH REIGN I DROVE A THREEFOOT WHITEPINE
STAKE IN THE TURF BY THE ROADSIDE AND WROTE THE NAME AND DATES ON IT
ABREAST THE MIDDLE OF THE PORCHFRONT STOOD A GREAT GRANITE FLOWERVASE
OVERFLOWING WITH A CATARACT OF BRIGHTYELLOW FLOWERSI CANT THINK OF
THEIR NAME THE VASE WAS WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR WE PUT HIS NAME ON IT
AND HIS ACCESSION DATE WE STARTED FROM THAT AND MEASURED OFF
TWENTYONE FEET OF THE ROAD AND DROVE WILLIAM RUFUSS STAKE THEN
THIRTEEN FEET AND DROVE THE FIRST HENRYS STAKE THEN THIRTYFIVE FEET
AND DROVE STEPHENS THEN NINETEEN FEET WHICH BROUGHT US JUST PAST THE
SUMMERHOUSE ON THE LEFT THEN WE STAKED OUT THIRTYFIVE TEN AND
SEVENTEEN FOR THE SECOND HENRY AND RICHARD AND JOHN TURNED THE CURVE
AND ENTERED UPON JUST WHAT WAS NEEDED FOR HENRY IIIA LEVEL STRAIGHT
STRETCH OF FIFTYSIX FEET OF ROAD WITHOUT A CRINKLE IN IT AND IT LAY
EXACTLY IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GROUNDS THERE
COULDNT HAVE BEEN A BETTER PLACE FOR THAT LONG REIGN YOU COULD STAND
ON THE PORCH AND SEE THOSE TWO WIDEAPART STAKES ALMOST WITH YOUR EYES
SHUT FIG

THAT ISNT THE SHAPE OF THE ROADI HAVE BUNCHED IT UP LIKE THAT TO SAVE
ROOM THE ROAD HAD SOME GREAT CURVES IN IT BUT THEIR GRADUAL SWEEP WAS
SUCH THAT THEY WERE NO MAR TO HISTORY NO IN OUR ROAD ONE COULD TELL
AT A GLANCE WHO WAS WHO BY THE SIZE OF THE VACANCY BETWEEN STAKESWITH
LOCALITY TO HELP OF COURSE

ALTHOUGH I AM AWAY OFF HERE IN A SWEDISH VILLAGE AND THOSE STAKES
DID NOT STAND TILL THE SNOW CAME I CAN SEE THEM TODAY AS PLAINLY AS
EVER AND WHENEVER I THINK OF AN ENGLISH MONARCH HIS STAKES RISE BEFORE
ME OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND I NOTICE THE LARGE OR SMALL SPACE WHICH HE
TAKES UP ON OUR ROAD ARE YOUR KINGS SPACED OFF IN YOUR MIND WHEN YOU
THINK OF RICHARD III AND OF JAMES II DO THE DURATIONS OF THEIR REIGNS
SEEM ABOUT ALIKE TO YOU IT ISNT SO TO ME I ALWAYS NOTICE THAT
THERES A FOOTS DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU THINK OF HENRY III DO YOU SEE A
GREAT LONG STRETCH OF STRAIGHT ROAD I DO AND JUST AT THE END WHERE IT
JOINS ON TO EDWARD I I ALWAYS SEE A SMALL PEARBUSH WITH ITS GREEN
FRUIT HANGING DOWN WHEN I THINK OF THE COMMONWEALTH I SEE A SHADY
LITTLE GROUP OF THESE SMALL SAPLINGS WHICH WE CALLED THE OAK PARLOR
WHEN I THINK OF GEORGE III I SEE HIM STRETCHING UP THE HILL PART OF
HIM OCCUPIED BY A FLIGHT OF STONE STEPS AND I CAN LOCATE STEPHEN TO AN
INCH WHEN HE COMES INTO MY MIND FOR HE JUST FILLED THE STRETCH WHICH
WENT BY THE SUMMERHOUSE VICTORIAS REIGN REACHED ALMOST TO MY STUDY
DOOR ON THE FIRST LITTLE SUMMIT THERES SIXTEEN FEET TO BE ADDED NOW
I BELIEVE THAT THAT WOULD CARRY IT TO A BIG PINETREE THAT WAS
SHATTERED BY SOME LIGHTNING ONE SUMMER WHEN IT WAS TRYING TO HIT ME

SUMMER OF


WE GOT A GOOD DEAL OF FUN OUT OF THE HISTORY ROAD AND EXERCISE TOO
WE TROTTED THE COURSE FROM THE CONQUEROR TO THE STUDY THE CHILDREN
CALLING OUT THE NAMES DATES AND LENGTH OF REIGNS AS WE PASSED THE
STAKES GOING A GOOD GAIT ALONG THE LONG REIGNS BUT SLOWING DOWN WHEN
WE CAME UPON PEOPLE LIKE MARY AND EDWARD VI AND THE SHORT STUART AND
PLANTAGENET TO GIVE TIME TO GET IN THE STATISTICS I OFFERED PRIZES
TOOAPPLES I THREW ONE AS FAR AS I COULD SEND IT AND THE CHILD THAT
FIRST SHOUTED THE REIGN IT FELL IN GOT THE APPLE

THE CHILDREN WERE ENCOURAGED TO STOP LOCATING THINGS AS BEING OVER BY
THE ARBOR OR IN THE OAK PARLOR OR UP AT THE STONE STEPS AND SAY
INSTEAD THAT THE THINGS WERE IN STEPHEN OR IN THE COMMONWEALTH OR IN
GEORGE III THEY GOT THE HABIT WITHOUT TROUBLE TO HAVE THE LONG ROAD
MAPPED OUT WITH SUCH EXACTNESS WAS A GREAT BOON FOR ME FOR I HAD THE
HABIT OF LEAVING BOOKS AND OTHER ARTICLES LYING AROUND EVERYWHERE AND
HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN ABLE TO DEFINITELY NAME THE PLACE AND SO HAD
OFTEN BEEN OBLIGED TO GO TO FETCH THEM MYSELF TO SAVE TIME AND
FAILURE BUT NOW I COULD NAME THE REIGN I LEFT THEM IN AND SEND THE
CHILDREN

NEXT I THOUGHT I WOULD MEASURE OFF THE FRENCH REIGNS AND PEG THEM
ALONGSIDE THE ENGLISH ONES SO THAT WE COULD ALWAYS HAVE
CONTEMPORANEOUS FRENCH HISTORY UNDER OUR EYES AS WE WENT OUR ENGLISH
ROUNDS WE PEGGED THEM DOWN TO THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR THEN THREW THE
IDEA ASIDE I DO NOT NOW REMEMBER WHY AFTER THAT WE MADE THE ENGLISH
PEGS FENCE IN EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN HISTORY AS WELL AS ENGLISH AND
THAT ANSWERED VERY WELL ENGLISH AND ALIEN POETS STATESMEN ARTISTS
HEROES BATTLES PLAGUES CATACLYSMS REVOLUTIONSWE SHOVELED THEM ALL
INTO THE ENGLISH FENCES ACCORDING TO THEIR DATES DO YOU UNDERSTAND WE
GAVE WASHINGTONS BIRTH TO GEORGE IIS PEGS AND HIS DEATH TO GEORGE
IIIS GEORGE II GOT THE LISBON EARTHQUAKE AND GEORGE III THE
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE GOETHE SHAKESPEARE NAPOLEON SAVONAROLA
JOAN OF ARC THE FRENCH REVOLUTION THE EDICT OF NANTES CLIVE
WELLINGTON WATERLOO PLASSEY PATAY COWPENS SARATOGA THE BATTLE OF
THE BOYNE THE INVENTION OF THE LOGARITHMS THE MICROSCOPE THE
STEAMENGINE THE TELEGRAPHANYTHING AND EVERYTHING ALL OVER THE
WORLDWE DUMPED IT ALL IN AMONG THE ENGLISH PEGS ACCORDING TO ITS DATE
AND REGARDLESS OF ITS NATIONALITY

IF THE ROADPEGGING SCHEME HAD NOT SUCCEEDED I SHOULD HAVE LODGED THE
KINGS IN THE CHILDRENS HEADS BY MEANS OF PICTURESTHAT IS I SHOULD
HAVE TRIED IT MIGHT HAVE FAILED FOR THE PICTURES COULD ONLY BE
EFFECTIVE WHEN MADE BY THE PUPIL NOT THE MASTER FOR IT IS THE WORK
PUT UPON THE DRAWING THAT MAKES THE DRAWING STAY IN THE MEMORY AND MY
CHILDREN WERE TOO LITTLE TO MAKE DRAWINGS AT THAT TIME AND BESIDES
THEY HAD NO TALENT FOR ART WHICH IS STRANGE FOR IN OTHER WAYS THEY
ARE LIKE ME

BUT I WILL DEVELOP THE PICTURE PLAN NOW HOPING THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO USE IT IT WILL COME GOOD FOR INDOORS WHEN THE WEATHER IS BAD AND
ONE CANNOT GO OUTSIDE AND PEG A ROAD LET US IMAGINE THAT THE KINGS ARE
A PROCESSION AND THAT THEY HAVE COME OUT OF THE ARK AND DOWN ARARAT
FOR EXERCISE AND ARE NOW STARTING BACK AGAIN UP THE ZIGZAG ROAD THIS
WILL BRING SEVERAL OF THEM INTO VIEW AT ONCE AND EACH ZIGZAG WILL
REPRESENT THE LENGTH OF A KINGS REIGN

AND SO ON YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY OF SPACE FOR BY MY PROJECT YOU WILL
USE THE PARLOR WALL YOU DO NOT MARK ON THE WALL THAT WOULD CAUSE
TROUBLE YOU ONLY ATTACH BITS OF PAPER TO IT WITH PINS OR THUMBTACKS
THESE WILL LEAVE NO MARK

TAKE YOUR PEN NOW AND TWENTYONE PIECES OF WHITE PAPER EACH TWO
INCHES SQUARE AND WE WILL DO THE TWENTYONE YEARS OF THE CONQUERORS
REIGN ON EACH SQUARE DRAW A PICTURE OF A WHALE AND WRITE THE DATES AND
TERM OF SERVICE WE CHOOSE THE WHALE FOR SEVERAL REASONS ITS NAME AND
WILLIAMS BEGIN WITH THE SAME LETTER IT IS THE BIGGEST FISH THAT
SWIMS AND WILLIAM IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS FIGURE IN ENGLISH HISTORY IN
THE WAY OF A LANDMARK FINALLY A WHALE IS ABOUT THE EASIEST THING TO
DRAW BY THE TIME YOU HAVE DRAWN TWENTYONE WALES AND WRITTEN WILLIAM
ITWENTYONE YEARS TWENTYONE TIMES THOSE DETAILS WILL BE
YOUR PROPERTY YOU CANNOT DISLODGE THEM FROM YOUR MEMORY WITH ANYTHING
BUT DYNAMITE I WILL MAKE A SAMPLE FOR YOU TO COPY FIG

I HAVE GOT HIS CHIN UP TOO HIGH BUT THAT IS NO MATTER HE IS LOOKING
FOR HAROLD IT MAY BE THAT A WHALE HASNT THAT FIN UP THERE ON HIS
BACK BUT I DO NOT REMEMBER AND SO SINCE THERE IS A DOUBT IT IS BEST
TO ERR ON THE SAFE SIDE HE LOOKS BETTER ANYWAY THAN HE WOULD WITHOUT
IT

BE VERY CAREFUL AND ATTENTIVE WHILE YOU ARE DRAWING YOUR FIRST WHALE
FROM MY SAMPLE AND WRITING THE WORD AND FIGURES UNDER IT SO THAT YOU
WILL NOT NEED TO COPY THE SAMPLE ANY MORE COMPARE YOUR COPY WITH THE
SAMPLE EXAMINE CLOSELY IF YOU FIND YOU HAVE GOT EVERYTHING RIGHT AND
CAN SHUT YOUR EYES AND SEE THE PICTURE AND CALL THE WORDS AND FIGURES
THEN TURN THE SAMPLE AND COPY UPSIDE DOWN AND MAKE THE NEXT COPY FROM
MEMORY AND ALSO THE NEXT AND NEXT AND SO ON ALWAYS DRAWING AND
WRITING FROM MEMORY UNTIL YOU HAVE FINISHED THE WHOLE TWENTYONE THIS
WILL TAKE YOU TWENTY MINUTES OR THIRTY AND BY THAT TIME YOU WILL FIND
THAT YOU CAN MAKE A WHALE IN LESS TIME THAN AN UNPRACTICED PERSON CAN
MAKE A SARDINE ALSO UP TO THE TIME YOU DIE YOU WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO
FURNISH WILLIAMS DATES TO ANY IGNORANT PERSON THAT INQUIRES AFTER
THEM

YOU WILL NOW TAKE THIRTEEN PIECES OF BLUE PAPER EACH TWO INCHES
SQUARE AND DO WILLIAM II FIG

MAKE HIM SPOUT HIS WATER FORWARD INSTEAD OF BACKWARD ALSO MAKE HIM
SMALL AND STICK A HARPOON IN HIM AND GIVE HIM THAT SICK LOOK IN THE
EYE OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT SEEM TO BE CONTINUING THE OTHER WILLIAM AND
THAT WOULD BE CONFUSING AND A DAMAGE IT IS QUITE RIGHT TO MAKE HIM
SMALL HE WAS ONLY ABOUT A NO WHALE OR ALONG THERE SOMEWHERE
THERE WASNT ROOM IN HIM FOR HIS FATHERS GREAT SPIRIT THE BARB OF
THAT HARPOON OUGHT NOT TO SHOW LIKE THAT BECAUSE IT IS DOWN INSIDE THE
WHALE AND OUGHT TO BE OUT OF SIGHT BUT IT CANNOT BE HELPED IF THE
BARB WERE REMOVED PEOPLE WOULD THINK SOME ONE HAD STUCK A WHIPSTOCK
INTO THE WHALE IT IS BEST TO LEAVE THE BARB THE WAY IT IS THEN EVERY
ONE WILL KNOW IT IS A HARPOON AND ATTENDING TO BUSINESS REMEMBERDRAW
FROM THE COPY ONLY ONCE MAKE YOUR OTHER TWELVE AND THE INSCRIPTION
FROM MEMORY

NOW THE TRUTH IS THAT WHENEVER YOU HAVE COPIED A PICTURE AND ITS
INSCRIPTION ONCE FROM MY SAMPLE AND TWO OR THREE TIMES FROM MEMORY THE
DETAILS WILL STAY WITH YOU AND BE HARD TO FORGET AFTER THAT IF YOU
LIKE YOU MAY MAKE MERELY THE WHALES HEAD AND WATERSPOUT FOR THE
CONQUEROR TILL YOU END HIS REIGN EACH TIME SAYING THE INSCRIPTION IN
PLACE OF WRITING IT AND IN THE CASE OF WILLIAM II MAKE THE HARPOON
ALONE AND SAY OVER THE INSCRIPTION EACH TIME YOU DO IT YOU SEE IT
WILL TAKE NEARLY TWICE AS LONG TO DO THE FIRST SET AS IT WILL TO DO THE
SECOND AND THAT WILL GIVE YOU A MARKED SENSE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN
LENGTH OF THE TWO REIGNS

NEXT DO HENRY I ON THIRTYFIVE SQUARES OF RED PAPER FIG

THAT IS A HEN AND SUGGESTS HENRY BY FURNISHING THE FIRST SYLLABLE
WHEN YOU HAVE REPEATED THE HEN AND THE INSCRIPTION UNTIL YOU ARE
PERFECTLY SURE OF THEM DRAW MERELY THE HENS HEAD THE REST OF THE
THIRTYFIVE TIMES SAYING OVER THE INSCRIPTION EACH TIME THUS FIG


YOU BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND NOW HOW THIS PROCESSION IS GOING TO LOOK WHEN
IT IS ON THE WALL FIRST THERE WILL BE THE CONQUERORS TWENTYONE
WHALES AND WATERSPOUTS THE TWENTYONE WHITE SQUARES JOINED TO ONE
ANOTHER AND MAKING A WHITE STRIPE THREE AND ONEHALF FEET LONG THE
THIRTEEN BLUE SQUARES OF WILLIAM II WILL BE JOINED TO THATA BLUE
STRIPE TWO FEET TWO INCHES LONG FOLLOWED BY HENRYS RED STRIPE FIVE
FEET TEN INCHES LONG AND SO ON THE COLORED DIVISIONS WILL SMARTLY
SHOW TO THE EYE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE LENGTH OF THE REIGNS AND IMPRESS
THE PROPORTIONS ON THE MEMORY AND THE UNDERSTANDING FIG

STEPHEN OF BLOIS COMES NEXT HE REQUIRES NINETEEN TWOINCH SQUARES OF
YELLOW PAPER FIG

THAT IS A STEER THE SOUND SUGGESTS THE BEGINNING OF STEPHENS NAME I
CHOOSE IT FOR THAT REASON I CAN MAKE A BETTER STEER THAN THAT WHEN I
AM NOT EXCITED BUT THIS ONE WILL DO IT IS A GOODENOUGH STEER FOR
HISTORY THE TAIL IS DEFECTIVE BUT IT ONLY WANTS STRAIGHTENING OUT

NEXT COMES HENRY II GIVE HIM THIRTYFIVE SQUARES OF RED PAPER THESE
HENS MUST FACE WEST LIKE THE FORMER ONES FIG

THIS HEN DIFFERS FROM THE OTHER ONE HE IS ON HIS WAY TO INQUIRE WHAT
HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN CANTERBURY

NOW WE ARRIVE AT RICHARD I CALLED RICHARD OF THE LIONHEART BECAUSE
HE WAS A BRAVE FIGHTER AND WAS NEVER SO CONTENTED AS WHEN HE WAS
LEADING CRUSADES IN PALESTINE AND NEGLECTING HIS AFFAIRS AT HOME GIVE
HIM TEN SQUARES OF WHITE PAPER FIG

THAT IS A LION HIS OFFICE IS TO REMIND YOU OF THE LIONHEARTED
RICHARD THERE IS SOMETHING THE MATTER WITH HIS LEGS BUT I DO NOT
QUITE KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY DO NOT SEEM RIGHT I THINK THE HIND ONES
ARE THE MOST UNSATISFACTORY THE FRONT ONES ARE WELL ENOUGH THOUGH IT
WOULD BE BETTER IF THEY WERE RIGHTS AND LEFTS

NEXT COMES KING JOHN AND HE WAS A POOR CIRCUMSTANCE HE WAS CALLED
LACKLAND HE GAVE HIS REALM TO THE POPE LET HIM HAVE SEVENTEEN SQUARES
OF YELLOW PAPER FIG

THAT CREATURE IS A JAMBOREE IT LOOKS LIKE A TRADEMARK BUT THAT IS
ONLY AN ACCIDENT AND NOT INTENTIONAL IT IS PREHISTORIC AND EXTINCT IT
USED TO ROAM THE EARTH IN THE OLD SILURIAN TIMES AND LAY EGGS AND
CATCH FISH AND CLIMB TREES AND LIVE ON FOSSILS FOR IT WAS OF A MIXED
BREED WHICH WAS THE FASHION THEN IT WAS VERY FIERCE AND THE OLD
SILURIANS WERE AFRAID OF IT BUT THIS IS A TAME ONE PHYSICALLY IT HAS
NO REPRESENTATIVE NOW BUT ITS MIND HAS BEEN TRANSMITTED FIRST I DREW
IT SITTING DOWN BUT HAVE TURNED IT THE OTHER WAY NOW BECAUSE I THINK
IT LOOKS MORE ATTRACTIVE AND SPIRITED WHEN ONE END OF IT IS GALLOPING
I LOVE TO THINK THAT IN THIS ATTITUDE IT GIVES US A PLEASANT IDEA OF
JOHN COMING ALL IN A HAPPY EXCITEMENT TO SEE WHAT THE BARONS HAVE BEEN
ARRANGING FOR HIM AT RUNNYMEDE WHILE THE OTHER ONE GIVES US AN IDEA OF
HIM SITTING DOWN TO WRING HIS HANDS AND GRIEVE OVER IT

WE NOW COME TO HENRY III RED SQUARES AGAIN OF COURSEFIFTYSIX OF
THEM WE MUST MAKE ALL THE HENRYS THE SAME COLOR IT WILL MAKE THEIR
LONG REIGNS SHOW UP HANDSOMELY ON THE WALL AMONG ALL THE EIGHT HENRYS
THERE WERE BUT TWO SHORT ONES A LUCKY NAME AS FAR AS LONGEVITY GOES
THE REIGNS OF SIX OF THE HENRYS COVER YEARS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
WELL TO NAME ALL THE ROYAL PRINCES HENRY BUT THIS WAS OVERLOOKED UNTIL
IT WAS TOO LATE FIG

THIS IS THE BEST ONE YET HE IS ON HIS WAY TO HAVE A LOOK AT THE
FIRST HOUSE OF COMMONS IN ENGLISH HISTORY IT WAS A MONUMENTAL EVENT
THE SITUATION OF THE HOUSE AND WAS THE SECOND GREAT LIBERTY LANDMARK
WHICH THE CENTURY HAD SET UP I HAVE MADE HENRY LOOKING GLAD BUT THIS
WAS NOT INTENTIONAL

EDWARD I COMES NEXT LIGHTBROWN PAPER THIRTYFIVE SQUARES FIG


THAT IS AN EDITOR HE IS TRYING TO THINK OF A WORD HE PROPS HIS FEET
ON THE CHAIR WHICH IS THE EDITORS WAY THEN HE CAN THINK BETTER I DO
NOT CARE MUCH FOR THIS ONE HIS EARS ARE NOT ALIKE STILL EDITOR
SUGGESTS THE SOUND OF EDWARD AND HE WILL DO I COULD MAKE HIM BETTER
IF I HAD A MODEL BUT I MADE THIS ONE FROM MEMORY BUT IT IS NO
PARTICULAR MATTER THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE ANYWAY THEY ARE CONCEITED AND
TROUBLESOME AND DONT PAY ENOUGH EDWARD WAS THE FIRST REALLY ENGLISH
KING THAT HAD YET OCCUPIED THE THRONE THE EDITOR IN THE PICTURE
PROBABLY LOOKS JUST AS EDWARD LOOKED WHEN IT WAS FIRST BORNE IN UPON
HIM THAT THIS WAS SO HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE EXPRESSED GRATIFICATION AND
PRIDE MIXED WITH STUPEFACTION AND ASTONISHMENT

EDWARD II NOW TWENTY BLUE SQUARES FIG

ANOTHER EDITOR THAT THING BEHIND HIS EAR IS HIS PENCIL WHENEVER HE
FINDS A BRIGHT THING IN YOUR MANUSCRIPT HE STRIKES IT OUT WITH THAT
THAT DOES HIM GOOD AND MAKES HIM SMILE AND SHOW HIS TEETH THE WAY HE
IS DOING IN THE PICTURE THIS ONE HAS JUST BEEN STRIKING OUT A SMART
THING AND NOW HE IS SITTING THERE WITH HIS THUMBS IN HIS VESTHOLES
GLOATING THEY ARE FULL OF ENVY AND MALICE EDITORS ARE THIS PICTURE
WILL SERVE TO REMIND YOU THAT EDWARD II WAS THE FIRST ENGLISH KING WHO
WAS DEPOSED UPON DEMAND HE SIGNED HIS DEPOSITION HIMSELF HE HAD
FOUND KINGSHIP A MOST AGGRAVATING AND DISAGREEABLE OCCUPATION AND YOU
CAN SEE BY THE LOOK OF HIM THAT HE IS GLAD HE RESIGNED HE HAS PUT HIS
BLUE PENCIL UP FOR GOOD NOW HE HAD STRUCK OUT MANY A GOOD THING WITH
IT IN HIS TIME

EDWARD III NEXT FIFTY RED SQUARES FIG

THIS EDITOR IS A CRITIC HE HAS PULLED OUT HIS CARVINGKNIFE AND HIS
TOMAHAWK AND IS STARTING AFTER A BOOK WHICH HE IS GOING TO HAVE FOR
BREAKFAST THIS ONES ARMS ARE PUT ON WRONG I DID NOT NOTICE IT AT
FIRST BUT I SEE IT NOW SOMEHOW HE HAS GOT HIS RIGHT ARM ON HIS LEFT
SHOULDER AND HIS LEFT ARM ON THE RIGHT SHOULDER AND THIS SHOWS US THE
BACK OF HIS HANDS IN BOTH INSTANCES IT MAKES HIM LEFTHANDED ALL
AROUND WHICH IS A THING WHICH HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE EXCEPT
PERHAPS IN A MUSEUM THAT IS THE WAY WITH ART WHEN IT IS NOT ACQUIRED
BUT BORN TO YOU YOU START IN TO MAKE SOME SIMPLE LITTLE THING NOT
SUSPECTING THAT YOUR GENIUS IS BEGINNING TO WORK AND SWELL AND STRAIN
IN SECRET AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE IS A CONVULSION AND YOU FETCH OUT
SOMETHING ASTONISHING THIS IS CALLED INSPIRATION IT IS AN ACCIDENT
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT IS COMING I MIGHT HAVE TRIED AS MUCH AS A YEAR
TO THINK OF SUCH A STRANGE THING AS AN ALLAROUND LEFTHANDED MAN AND I
COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT FOR THE MORE YOU TRY TO THINK OF AN UNTHINKABLE
THING THE MORE IT ELUDES YOU BUT IT CANT ELUDE INSPIRATION YOU HAVE
ONLY TO BAIT WITH INSPIRATION AND YOU WILL GET IT EVERY TIME LOOK AT
BOTTICELLIS SPRING THOSE SNAKY WOMEN WERE UNTHINKABLE BUT
INSPIRATION SECURED THEM FOR US THANKS TO GOODNESS IT IS TOO LATE TO
REORGANIZE THIS EDITORCRITIC NOW WE WILL LEAVE HIM AS HE IS HE WILL
SERVE TO REMIND US

RICHARD II NEXT TWENTYTWO WHITE SQUARES FIG

WE USE THE LION AGAIN BECAUSE THIS IS ANOTHER RICHARD LIKE EDWARD II
HE WAS DEPOSED HE IS TAKING A LAST SAD LOOK AT HIS CROWN BEFORE THEY
TAKE IT AWAY THERE WAS NOT ROOM ENOUGH AND I HAVE MADE IT TOO SMALL
BUT IT NEVER FITTED HIM ANYWAY

NOW WE TURN THE CORNER OF THE CENTURY WITH A NEW LINE OF MONARCHSTHE
LANCASTRIAN KINGS

HENRY IV FOURTEEN SQUARES OF YELLOW PAPER FIG

THIS HEN HAS LAID THE EGG OF A NEW DYNASTY AND REALIZES THE IMPOSING
MAGNITUDE OF THE EVENT SHE IS GIVING NOTICE IN THE USUAL WAY YOU
NOTICE I AM IMPROVING IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF HENS AT FIRST I MADE THEM
TOO MUCH LIKE OTHER ANIMALS BUT THIS ONE IS ORTHODOX I MENTION THIS
TO ENCOURAGE YOU YOU WILL FIND THAT THE MORE YOU PRACTICE THE MORE
ACCURATE YOU WILL BECOME I COULD ALWAYS DRAW ANIMALS BUT BEFORE I WAS
EDUCATED I COULD NOT TELL WHAT KIND THEY WERE WHEN I GOT THEM DONE BUT
NOW I CAN KEEP UP YOUR COURAGE IT WILL BE THE SAME WITH YOU ALTHOUGH
YOU MAY NOT THINK IT THIS HENRY DIED THE YEAR AFTER JOAN OF ARC WAS
BORN

HENRY V NINE BLUE SQUARES FIG

THERE YOU SEE HIM LOST IN MEDITATION OVER THE MONUMENT WHICH RECORDS
THE AMAZING FIGURES OF THE BATTLE OF AGINCOURT FRENCH HISTORY SAYS
ENGLISHMEN ROUTED FRENCHMEN THERE AND ENGLISH HISTORIANS
SAY THAT THE FRENCH LOSS IN KILLED AND WOUNDED WAS

HENRY VI THIRTYNINE RED SQUARES FIG

THIS IS POOR HENRY VI WHO REIGNED LONG AND SCORED MANY MISFORTUNES
AND HUMILIATIONS ALSO TWO GREAT DISASTERS HE LOST FRANCE TO JOAN OF
ARC AND HE LOST THE THRONE AND ENDED THE DYNASTY WHICH HENRY IV HAD
STARTED IN BUSINESS WITH SUCH GOOD PROSPECTS IN THE PICTURE WE SEE HIM
SAD AND WEARY AND DOWNCAST WITH THE SCEPTER FALLING FROM HIS NERVELESS
GRASP IT IS A PATHETIC QUENCHING OF A SUN WHICH HAD RISEN IN SUCH
SPLENDOR

EDWARD IV TWENTYTWO LIGHTBROWN SQUARES FIG

THAT IS A SOCIETY EDITOR SITTING THERE ELEGANTLY DRESSED WITH HIS
LEGS CROSSED IN THAT INDOLENT WAY OBSERVING THE CLOTHES THE LADIES
WEAR SO THAT HE CAN DESCRIBE THEM FOR HIS PAPER AND MAKE THEM OUT
FINER THAN THEY ARE AND GET BRIBES FOR IT AND BECOME WEALTHY THAT
FLOWER WHICH HE IS WEARING IN HIS BUTTONHOLE IS A ROSEA WHITE ROSE A
YORK ROSEAND WILL SERVE TO REMIND US OF THE WAR OF THE ROSES AND THAT
THE WHITE ONE WAS THE WINNING COLOR WHEN EDWARD GOT THE THRONE AND
DISPOSSESSED THE LANCASTRIAN DYNASTY

EDWARD V ONETHIRD OF A BLACK SQUARE FIG

HIS UNCLE RICHARD HAD HIM MURDERED IN THE TOWER WHEN YOU GET THE
REIGNS DISPLAYED UPON THE WALL THIS ONE WILL BE CONSPICUOUS AND EASILY
REMEMBERED IT IS THE SHORTEST ONE IN ENGLISH HISTORY EXCEPT LADY JANE
GREYS WHICH WAS ONLY NINE DAYS SHE IS NEVER OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED AS
A MONARCH OF ENGLAND BUT IF YOU OR I SHOULD EVER OCCUPY A THRONE WE
SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE PROPER NOTICE TAKEN OF IT AND IT WOULD BE ONLY
FAIR AND RIGHT TOO PARTICULARLY IF WE GAINED NOTHING BY IT AND LOST
OUR LIVES BESIDES

RICHARD III TWO WHITE SQUARES FIG

THAT IS NOT A VERY GOOD LION BUT RICHARD WAS NOT A VERY GOOD KING YOU
WOULD THINK THAT THIS LION HAS TWO HEADS BUT THAT IS NOT SO ONE IS
ONLY A SHADOW THERE WOULD BE SHADOWS FOR THE REST OF HIM BUT THERE
WAS NOT LIGHT ENOUGH TO GO ROUND IT BEING A DULL DAY WITH ONLY
FLEETING SUNGLIMPSES NOW AND THEN RICHARD HAD A HUMPED BACK AND A
HARD HEART AND FELL AT THE BATTLE OF BOSWORTH I DO NOT KNOW THE NAME
OF THAT FLOWER IN THE POT BUT WE WILL USE IT AS RICHARDS TRADEMARK
FOR IT IS SAID THAT IT GROWS IN ONLY ONE PLACE IN THE WORLDBOSWORTH
FIELDAND TRADITION SAYS IT NEVER GREW THERE UNTIL RICHARDS ROYAL
BLOOD WARMED ITS HIDDEN SEED TO LIFE AND MADE IT GROW

HENRY VII TWENTYFOUR BLUE SQUARES FIG

HENRY VII HAD NO LIKING FOR WARS AND TURBULENCE HE PREFERRED PEACE
AND QUIET AND THE GENERAL PROSPERITY WHICH SUCH CONDITIONS CREATE HE
LIKED TO SIT ON THAT KIND OF EGGS ON HIS OWN PRIVATE ACCOUNT AS WELL AS
THE NATIONS AND HATCH THEM OUT AND COUNT UP THE RESULT WHEN HE DIED
HE LEFT HIS HEIR POUNDS WHICH WAS A MOST UNUSUAL FORTUNE FOR
A KING TO POSSESS IN THOSE DAYS COLUMBUSS GREAT ACHIEVEMENT GAVE HIM
THE DISCOVERYFEVER AND HE SENT SEBASTIAN CABOT TO THE NEW WORLD TO
SEARCH OUT SOME FOREIGN TERRITORY FOR ENGLAND THAT IS CABOTS SHIP UP
THERE IN THE CORNER THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT ENGLAND WENT FAR
ABROAD TO ENLARGE HER ESTATEBUT NOT THE LAST

HENRY VIII THIRTYEIGHT RED SQUARES FIG

THAT IS HENRY VIII SUPPRESSING A MONASTERY IN HIS ARROGANT FASHION

EDWARD VI SIX SQUARES OF YELLOW PAPER FIG

HE IS THE LAST EDWARD TO DATE IT IS INDICATED BY THAT THING OVER HIS
HEAD WHICH IS A LASTSHOEMAKERS LAST

MARY FIVE SQUARES OF BLACK PAPER FIG

THE PICTURE REPRESENTS A BURNING MARTYR HE IS IN BACK OF THE SMOKE
THE FIRST THREE LETTERS OF MARYS NAME AND THE FIRST THREE OF THE WORD
MARTYR ARE THE SAME MARTYRDOM WAS GOING OUT IN HER DAY AND MARTYRS
WERE BECOMING SCARCER BUT SHE MADE SEVERAL FOR THIS REASON SHE IS
SOMETIMES CALLED BLOODY MARY

THIS BRINGS US TO THE REIGN OF ELIZABETH AFTER PASSING THROUGH A
PERIOD OF NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED YEARS OF ENGLANDS HISTORY TO BE
EXACT I THINK YOU MAY NOW BE TRUSTED TO GO THE REST OF THE WAY WITHOUT
FURTHER LESSONS IN ART OR INSPIRATIONS IN THE MATTER OF IDEAS YOU HAVE
THE SCHEME NOW AND SOMETHING IN THE RULERS NAME OR CAREER WILL
SUGGEST THE PICTORIAL SYMBOL THE EFFORT OF INVENTING SUCH THINGS WILL
NOT ONLY HELP YOUR MEMORY BUT WILL DEVELOP ORIGINALITY IN ART SEE
WHAT IT HAS DONE FOR ME IF YOU DO NOT FIND THE PARLOR WALL BIG ENOUGH
FOR ALL OF ENGLANDS HISTORY CONTINUE IT INTO THE DININGROOM AND INTO
OTHER ROOMS THIS WILL MAKE THE WALLS INTERESTING AND INSTRUCTIVE AND
REALLY WORTH SOMETHING INSTEAD OF BEING JUST FLAT THINGS TO HOLD THE
HOUSE TOGETHER




THE MEMORABLE ASSASSINATION


NOTETHE ASSASSINATION OF THE EMPRESS OF AUSTRIA AT GENEVA SEPTEMBER
OCCURRED DURING MARK TWAINS AUSTRIAN RESIDENCE THE NEWS
CAME TO HIM AT KALTENLEUTGEBEN A SUMMER RESORT A LITTLE WAY OUT OF
VIENNA TO HIS FRIEND THE REV JOS H TWICHELL HE WROTE

THAT GOOD AND UNOFFENDING LADY THE EMPRESS IS KILLED BY A MADMAN
AND I AM LIVING IN THE MIDST OF WORLDHISTORY AGAIN THE QUEENS
JUBILEE LAST YEAR THE INVASION OF THE REICHSRATH BY THE POLICE AND
NOW THIS MURDER WHICH WILL STILL BE TALKED OF AND DESCRIBED AND
PAINTED A THOUSAND YEARS FROM NOW TO HAVE A PERSONAL FRIEND OF THE
WEARER OF TWO CROWNS BURST IN AT THE GATE IN THE DEEP DUSK OF THE
EVENING AND SAY IN A VOICE BROKEN WITH TEARS MY GOD THE EMPRESS IS
MURDERED AND FLY TOWARD HER HOME BEFORE WE CAN UTTER A QUESTIONWHY
IT BRINGS THE GIANT EVENT HOME TO YOU MAKES YOU A PART OF IT AND
PERSONALLY INTERESTED IT IS AS IF YOUR NEIGHBOR ANTONY SHOULD COME
FLYING AND SAY CAESAR IS BUTCHEREDTHE HEAD OF THE WORLD IS FALLEN

OF COURSE THERE IS NO TALK BUT OF THIS THE MOURNING IS UNIVERSAL AND
GENUINE THE CONSTERNATION IS STUPEFYING THE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE IS BEING
DRAPED WITH BLACK VIENNA WILL BE A SPECTACLE TO SEE BY NEXT SATURDAY
WHEN THE FUNERAL CORTEGE MARCHES

HE WAS STRONGLY MOVED BY THE TRAGEDY IMPELLED TO WRITE CONCERNING IT
HE PREPARED THE ARTICLE WHICH HERE FOLLOWS BUT DID NOT OFFER IT FOR
PUBLICATION PERHAPS FEELING THAT HIS OWN CLOSE ASSOCIATION WITH THE
COURT CIRCLES AT THE MOMENT PROHIBITED THIS PERSONAL UTTERANCE THERE
APPEARS NO SUCH REASON FOR WITHHOLDING ITS PUBLICATION NOW

A B P

THE MORE ONE THINKS OF THE ASSASSINATION THE MORE IMPOSING AND
TREMENDOUS THE EVENT BECOMES THE DESTRUCTION OF A CITY IS A LARGE
EVENT BUT IT IS ONE WHICH REPEATS ITSELF SEVERAL TIMES IN A THOUSAND
YEARS THE DESTRUCTION OF A THIRD PART OF A NATION BY PLAGUE AND FAMINE
IS A LARGE EVENT BUT IT HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES IN HISTORY THE
MURDER OF A KING IS A LARGE EVENT BUT IT HAS BEEN FREQUENT

THE MURDER OF AN EMPRESS IS THE LARGEST OF ALL LARGE EVENTS ONE MUST
GO BACK ABOUT TWO THOUSAND YEARS TO FIND AN INSTANCE TO PUT WITH THIS
ONE THE OLDEST FAMILY OF UNCHALLENGED DESCENT IN CHRISTENDOM LIVES IN
ROME AND TRACES ITS LINE BACK SEVENTEEN HUNDRED YEARS BUT NO MEMBER OF
IT HAS BEEN PRESENT IN THE EARTH WHEN AN EMPRESS WAS MURDERED UNTIL
NOW MANY A TIME DURING THESE SEVENTEEN CENTURIES MEMBERS OF THAT
FAMILY HAVE BEEN STARTLED WITH THE NEWS OF EXTRAORDINARY EVENTSTHE
DESTRUCTION OF CITIES THE FALL OF THRONES THE MURDER OF KINGS THE
WRECK OF DYNASTIES THE EXTINCTION OF RELIGIONS THE BIRTH OF NEW
SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT AND THEIR DESCENDANTS HAVE BEEN BY TO HEAR OF IT
AND TALK ABOUT IT WHEN ALL THESE THINGS WERE REPEATED ONCE TWICE OR A
DOZEN TIMESBUT TO EVEN THAT FAMILY HAS COME NEWS AT LAST WHICH IS NOT
STALED BY USE HAS NO DUPLICATES IN THE LONG REACH OF ITS MEMORY

IT IS AN EVENT WHICH CONFERS A CURIOUS DISTINCTION UPON EVERY
INDIVIDUAL NOW LIVING IN THE WORLD HE HAS STOOD ALIVE AND BREATHING IN
THE PRESENCE OF AN EVENT SUCH AS HAS NOT FALLEN WITHIN THE EXPERIENCE
OF ANY TRACEABLE OR UNTRACEABLE ANCESTOR OF HIS FOR TWENTY CENTURIES
AND IT IS NOT LIKELY TO FALL WITHIN THE EXPERIENCE OF ANY DESCENDANT OF
HIS FOR TWENTY MORE

TIME HAS MADE SOME GREAT CHANGES SINCE THE ROMAN DAYS THE MURDER OF AN
EMPRESS THENEVEN THE ASSASSINATION OF CAESAR HIMSELFCOULD NOT
ELECTRIFY THE WORLD AS THIS MURDER HAS ELECTRIFIED IT FOR ONE REASON
THERE WAS THEN NOT MUCH OF A WORLD TO ELECTRIFY IT WAS A SMALL WORLD
AS TO KNOWN BULK AND IT HAD RATHER A THIN POPULATION BESIDES AND FOR
ANOTHER REASON THE NEWS TRAVELED SO SLOWLY THAT ITS TREMENDOUS INITIAL
THRILL WASTED AWAY WEEK BY WEEK AND MONTH BY MONTH ON THE JOURNEY
AND BY THE TIME IT REACHED THE REMOTER REGIONS THERE WAS BUT LITTLE OF
IT LEFT IT WAS NO LONGER A FRESH EVENT IT WAS A THING OF THE FAR
PAST IT WAS NOT PROPERLY NEWS IT WAS HISTORY BUT THE WORLD IS
ENORMOUS NOW AND PRODIGIOUSLY POPULATEDTHAT IS ONE CHANGE AND
ANOTHER IS THE LIGHTNING SWIFTNESS OF THE FLIGHT OF TIDINGS GOOD AND
BAD THE EMPRESS IS MURDERED WHEN THOSE AMAZING WORDS STRUCK UPON MY
EAR IN THIS AUSTRIAN VILLAGE LAST SATURDAY THREE HOURS AFTER THE
DISASTER I KNEW THAT IT WAS ALREADY OLD NEWS IN LONDON PARIS BERLIN
NEW YORK SAN FRANCISCO JAPAN CHINA MELBOURNE CAPE TOWN BOMBAY
MADRAS CALCUTTA AND THAT THE ENTIRE GLOBE WITH A SINGLE VOICE WAS
CURSING THE PERPETRATOR OF IT SINCE THE TELEGRAPH FIRST BEGAN TO
STRETCH ITSELF WIDER AND WIDER ABOUT THE EARTH LARGER AND INCREASINGLY
LARGER AREAS OF THE WORLD HAVE AS TIME WENT ON RECEIVED
SIMULTANEOUSLY THE SHOCK OF A GREAT CALAMITY BUT THIS IS THE FIRST
TIME IN HISTORY THAT THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE HAS BEEN SWEPT IN
A SINGLE INSTANT WITH THE THRILL OF SO GIGANTIC AN EVENT

AND WHO IS THE MIRACLEWORKER WHO HAS FURNISHED TO THE WORLD THIS
SPECTACLE ALL THE IRONIES ARE COMPACTED IN THE ANSWER HE IS AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE HUMAN LADDER AS THE ACCEPTED ESTIMATES OF DEGREE AND
VALUE GO A SOILED AND PATCHED YOUNG LOAFER WITHOUT GIFTS WITHOUT
TALENTS WITHOUT EDUCATION WITHOUT MORALS WITHOUT CHARACTER WITHOUT
ANY BORN CHARM OR ANY ACQUIRED ONE THAT WINS OR BEGUILES OR ATTRACTS
WITHOUT A SINGLE GRACE OF MIND OR HEART OR HAND THAT ANY TRAMP OR
PROSTITUTE COULD ENVY HIM AN UNFAITHFUL PRIVATE IN THE RANKS AN
INCOMPETENT STONECUTTER AN INEFFICIENT LACKEY IN A WORD A MANGY
OFFENSIVE EMPTY UNWASHED VULGAR GROSS MEPHITIC TIMID SNEAKING
HUMAN POLECAT AND IT WAS WITHIN THE PRIVILEGES AND POWERS OF THIS
SARCASM UPON THE HUMAN RACE TO REACH UPUPUPAND STRIKE FROM ITS FAR
SUMMIT IN THE SOCIAL SKIES THE WORLDS ACCEPTED IDEAL OF GLORY AND
MIGHT AND SPLENDOR AND SACREDNESS IT REALIZES TO US WHAT SORRY SHOWS
AND SHADOWS WE ARE WITHOUT OUR CLOTHES AND OUR PEDESTALS WE ARE POOR
THINGS AND MUCH OF A SIZE OUR DIGNITIES ARE NOT REAL OUR POMPS ARE
SHAMS AT OUR BEST AND STATELIEST WE ARE NOT SUNS AS WE PRETENDED AND
TEACH AND BELIEVE BUT ONLY CANDLES AND ANY BUMMER CAN BLOW US OUT

AND NOW WE GET REALIZED TO US ONCE MORE ANOTHER THING WHICH WE OFTEN
FORGETOR TRY TO THAT NO MAN HAS A WHOLLY UNDISEASED MIND THAT IN ONE
WAY OR ANOTHER ALL MEN ARE MAD MANY ARE MAD FOR MONEY WHEN THIS
MADNESS IS IN A MILD FORM IT IS HARMLESS AND THE MAN PASSES FOR SANE
BUT WHEN IT DEVELOPS POWERFULLY AND TAKES POSSESSION OF THE MAN IT CAN
MAKE HIM CHEAT ROB AND KILL AND WHEN HE HAS GOT HIS FORTUNE AND LOST
IT AGAIN IT CAN LAND HIM IN THE ASYLUM OR THE SUICIDES COFFIN LOVE IS
A MADNESS IF THWARTED IT DEVELOPS FAST IT CAN GROW TO A FRENZY OF
DESPAIR AND MAKE AN OTHERWISE SANE AND HIGHLY GIFTED PRINCE LIKE
RUDOLPH THROW AWAY THE CROWN OF AN EMPIRE AND SNUFF OUT HIS OWN LIFE
ALL THE WHOLE LIST OF DESIRES PREDILECTIONS AVERSIONS AMBITIONS
PASSIONS CARES GRIEFS REGRETS REMORSES ARE INCIPIENT MADNESS AND
READY TO GROW SPREAD AND CONSUME WHEN THE OCCASION COMES THERE ARE
NO HEALTHY MINDS AND NOTHING SAVES ANY MAN BUT ACCIDENTTHE ACCIDENT
OF NOT HAVING HIS MALADY PUT TO THE SUPREME TEST

ONE OF THE COMMONEST FORMS OF MADNESS IS THE DESIRE TO BE NOTICED THE
PLEASURE DERIVED FROM BEING NOTICED PERHAPS IT IS NOT MERELY COMMON
BUT UNIVERSAL IN ITS MILDEST FORM IT DOUBTLESS IS UNIVERSAL EVERY
CHILD IS PLEASED AT BEING NOTICED MANY INTOLERABLE CHILDREN PUT IN
THEIR WHOLE TIME IN DISTRESSING AND IDIOTIC EFFORT TO ATTRACT THE
ATTENTION OF VISITORS BOYS ARE ALWAYS SHOWING OFF APPARENTLY ALL
MEN AND WOMEN ARE GLAD AND GRATEFUL WHEN THEY FIND THAT THEY HAVE DONE
A THING WHICH HAS LIFTED THEM FOR A MOMENT OUT OF OBSCURITY AND CAUSED
WONDERING TALK THIS COMMON MADNESS CAN DEVELOP BY NURTURE INTO A
HUNGER FOR NOTORIETY IN ONE FOR FAME IN ANOTHER IT IS THIS MADNESS
FOR BEING NOTICED AND TALKED ABOUT WHICH HAS INVENTED KINGSHIP AND THE
THOUSAND OTHER DIGNITIES AND TRICKED THEM OUT WITH PRETTY AND SHOWY
FINERIES IT HAS MADE KINGS PICK ONE ANOTHERS POCKETS SCRAMBLE FOR
ONE ANOTHERS CROWNS AND ESTATES SLAUGHTER ONE ANOTHERS SUBJECTS IT
HAS RAISED UP PRIZEFIGHTERS AND POETS AND VILLAGE MAYORS AND LITTLE
AND BIG POLITICIANS AND BIG AND LITTLE CHARITYFOUNDERS AND BICYCLE
CHAMPIONS AND BANDITTI CHIEFS AND FRONTIER DESPERADOES AND
NAPOLEONS ANYTHING TO GET NOTORIETY ANYTHING TO SET THE VILLAGE OR
THE TOWNSHIP OR THE CITY OR THE STATE OR THE NATION OR THE PLANET
SHOUTING LOOKTHERE HE GOESTHAT IS THE MAN AND IN FIVE MINUTES
TIME AT NO COST OF BRAIN OR LABOR OR GENIUS THIS MANGY ITALIAN TRAMP
HAS BEATEN THEM ALL TRANSCENDED THEM ALL OUTSTRIPPED THEM ALL FOR IN
TIME THEIR NAMES WILL PERISH BUT BY THE FRIENDLY HELP OF THE INSANE
NEWSPAPERS AND COURTS AND KINGS AND HISTORIANS HIS IS SAFE TO LIVE AND
THUNDER IN THE WORLD ALL DOWN THE AGES AS LONG AS HUMAN SPEECH SHALL
ENDURE OH IF IT WERE NOT SO TRAGIC HOW LUDICROUS IT WOULD BE

SHE WAS SO BLAMELESS THE EMPRESS AND SO BEAUTIFUL IN MIND AND HEART
IN PERSON AND SPIRIT AND WHETHER WITH A CROWN UPON HER HEAD OR WITHOUT
IT AND NAMELESS A GRACE TO THE HUMAN RACE AND ALMOST A JUSTIFICATION
OF ITS CREATION WOULD BE INDEED BUT THAT THE ANIMAL THAT STRUCK
HER DOWN REESTABLISHES THE DOUBT

IN HER CHARACTER WAS EVERY QUALITY THAT IN WOMAN INVITES AND ENGAGES
RESPECT ESTEEM AFFECTION AND HOMAGE HER TASTES HER INSTINCTS AND
HER ASPIRATIONS WERE ALL HIGH AND FINE AND ALL HER LIFE HER HEART AND
BRAIN WERE BUSY WITH ACTIVITIES OF A NOBLE SORT SHE HAD HAD BITTER
GRIEFS BUT THEY DID NOT SOUR HER SPIRIT AND SHE HAD HAD THE HIGHEST
HONORS IN THE WORLDS GIFT BUT SHE WENT HER SIMPLE WAY UNSPOILED SHE
KNEW ALL RANKS AND WON THEM ALL AND MADE THEM HER FRIENDS AN ENGLISH
FISHERMANS WIFE SAID WHEN A BODY WAS IN TROUBLE SHE DIDNT SEND HER
HELP SHE BROUGHT IT HERSELF CROWNS HAVE ADORNED OTHERS BUT SHE
ADORNED HER CROWNS

IT WAS A SWIFT CELEBRITY THE ASSASSIN ACHIEVED AND IT IS MARKED BY
SOME CURIOUS CONTRASTS AT NOON LAST SATURDAY THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE
WORLD WHO WOULD HAVE CONSIDERED ACQUAINTANCESHIP WITH HIM A THING WORTH
CLAIMING OR MENTIONING NO ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN VAIN OF SUCH AN
ACQUAINTANCESHIP THE HUMBLEST HONEST BOOTBLACK WOULD NOT HAVE VALUED
THE FACT THAT HE HAD MET HIM OR SEEN HIM AT SOME TIME OR OTHER HE WAS
SUNK IN ABYSMAL OBSCURITY HE WAS AWAY BENEATH THE NOTICE OF THE BOTTOM
GRADES OF OFFICIALDOM THREE HOURS LATER HE WAS THE ONE SUBJECT OF
CONVERSATION IN THE WORLD THE GILDED GENERALS AND ADMIRALS AND
GOVERNORS WERE DISCUSSING HIM ALL THE KINGS AND QUEENS AND EMPERORS
HAD PUT ASIDE THEIR OTHER INTERESTS TO TALK ABOUT HIM AND WHEREVER
THERE WAS A MAN AT THE SUMMIT OF THE WORLD OR THE BOTTOM OF IT WHO BY
CHANCE HAD AT SOME TIME OR OTHER COME ACROSS THAT CREATURE HE
REMEMBERED IT WITH A SECRET SATISFACTION AND MENTIONED ITFOR IT WAS
A DISTINCTION NOW IT BRINGS HUMAN DIGNITY PRETTY LOW AND FOR A
MOMENT THE THING IS NOT QUITE REALIZABLEBUT IT IS PERFECTLY TRUE IF
THERE IS A KING WHO CAN REMEMBER NOW THAT HE ONCE SAW THAT CREATURE
IN A TIME PAST HE HAS LET THAT FACT OUT IN A MORE OR LESS STUDIEDLY
CASUAL AND INDIFFERENT WAY SOME DOZENS OF TIMES DURING THE PAST WEEK
FOR A KING IS MERELY HUMAN THE INSIDE OF HIM IS EXACTLY LIKE THE
INSIDE OF ANY OTHER PERSON AND IT IS HUMAN TO FIND SATISFACTION IN
BEING IN A KIND OF PERSONAL WAY CONNECTED WITH AMAZING EVENTS WE ARE
ALL PRIVATELY VAIN OF SUCH A THING WE ARE ALL ALIKE A KING IS A KING
BY ACCIDENT THE REASON THE REST OF US ARE NOT KINGS IS MERELY DUE TO
ANOTHER ACCIDENT WE ARE ALL MADE OUT OF THE SAME CLAY AND IT IS A
SUFFICIENTLY POOR QUALITY

BELOW THE KINGS THESE REMARKS ARE IN THE AIR THESE DAYS I KNOW IT AS
WELL AS IF I WERE HEARING THEM

THE COMMANDER HE WAS IN MY ARMY

THE GENERAL HE WAS IN MY CORPS

THE COLONEL HE WAS IN MY REGIMENT A BRUTE I REMEMBER HIM WELL

THE CAPTAIN HE WAS IN MY COMPANY A TROUBLESOME SCOUNDREL I REMEMBER
HIM WELL

THE SERGEANT DID I KNOW HIM AS WELL AS I KNOW YOU WHY EVERY
MORNING I USED TO ETC ETC A GLAD LONG STORY TOLD TO DEVOURING
EARS

THE LANDLADY MANYS THE TIME HE BOARDED WITH ME I CAN SHOW YOU HIS
VERY ROOM AND THE VERY BED HE SLEPT IN AND THE CHARCOAL MARK THERE ON
THE WALLHE MADE THAT MY LITTLE JOHNNY SAW HIM DO IT WITH HIS OWN
EYES DIDNT YOU JOHNNY

IT IS EASY TO SEE BY THE PAPERS THAT THE MAGISTRATE AND THE
CONSTABLES AND THE JAILER TREASURE UP THE ASSASSINS DAILY REMARKS AND
DOINGS AS PRECIOUS THINGS AND AS WALLOWING THIS WEEK IN SEAS OF
BLISSFUL DISTINCTION THE INTERVIEWER TOO HE TRIES TO LET ON THAT HE
IS NOT VAIN OF HIS PRIVILEGE OF CONTACT WITH THIS MAN WHOM FEW OTHERS
ARE ALLOWED TO GAZE UPON BUT HE IS HUMAN LIKE THE REST AND CAN NO
MORE KEEP HIS VANITY CORKED IN THAN COULD YOU OR I

SOME THINK THAT THIS MURDER IS A FRENZIED REVOLT AGAINST THE CRIMINAL
MILITARISM WHICH IS IMPOVERISHING EUROPE AND DRIVING THE STARVING POOR
MAD THAT HAS MANY CRIMES TO ANSWER FOR BUT NOT THIS ONE I THINK ONE
MAY NOT ATTRIBUTE TO THIS MAN A GENEROUS INDIGNATION AGAINST THE WRONGS
DONE THE POOR ONE MAY NOT DIGNIFY HIM WITH A GENEROUS IMPULSE OF ANY
KIND WHEN HE SAW HIS PHOTOGRAPH AND SAID I SHALL BE CELEBRATED HE
LAID BARE THE IMPULSE THAT PROMPTED HIM IT WAS A MERE HUNGER FOR
NOTORIETY THERE IS ANOTHER CONFESSED CASE OF THE KIND WHICH IS AS OLD
AS HISTORYTHE BURNING OF THE TEMPLE OF EPHESUS

AMONG THE INADEQUATE ATTEMPTS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ASSASSINATION WE MUST
CONCEDE HIGH RANK TO THE MANY WHICH HAVE DESCRIBED IT AS A PECULIARLY
BRUTAL CRIME AND THEN ADDED THAT IT WAS ORDAINED FROM ABOVE I THINK
THIS VERDICT WILL NOT BE POPULAR ABOVE IF THE DEED WAS ORDAINED FROM
ABOVE THERE IS NO RATIONAL WAY OF MAKING THIS PRISONER EVEN PARTIALLY
RESPONSIBLE FOR IT AND THE GENEVAN COURT CANNOT CONDEMN HIM WITHOUT
MANIFESTLY COMMITTING A CRIME LOGIC IS LOGIC AND BY DISREGARDING ITS
LAWS EVEN THE MOST PIOUS AND SHOWY THEOLOGIAN MAY BE BEGUILED INTO
PREFERRING CHARGES WHICH SHOULD NOT BE VENTURED UPON EXCEPT IN THE
SHELTER OF PLENTY OF LIGHTNINGRODS

I WITNESSED THE FUNERAL PROCESSION IN COMPANY WITH FRIENDS FROM THE
WINDOWS OF THE KRANTZ VIENNAS SUMPTUOUS NEW HOTEL WE CAME INTO TOWN
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FORENOON AND I WENT ON FOOT FROM THE STATION
BLACK FLAGS HUNG DOWN FROM ALL THE HOUSES THE ASPECTS WERE
SUNDAYLIKE THE CROWDS ON THE SIDEWALKS WERE QUIET AND MOVED SLOWLY
VERY FEW PEOPLE WERE SMOKING MANY LADIES WORE DEEP MOURNING GENTLEMEN
WERE IN BLACK AS A RULE CARRIAGES WERE SPEEDING IN ALL DIRECTIONS
WITH FOOTMEN AND COACHMEN IN BLACK CLOTHES AND WEARING BLACK COCKED
HATS THE SHOPS WERE CLOSED IN MANY WINDOWS WERE PICTURES OF THE
EMPRESS AS A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG BRIDE OF SEVENTEEN AS A SERENE AND
MAJESTIC LADY WITH ADDED YEARS AND FINALLY IN DEEP BLACK AND WITHOUT
ORNAMENTSTHE COSTUME SHE ALWAYS WORE AFTER THE TRAGIC DEATH OF HER SON
NINE YEARS AGO FOR HER HEART BROKE THEN AND LIFE LOST ALMOST ALL ITS
VALUE FOR HER THE PEOPLE STOOD GROUPED BEFORE THESE PICTURES AND NOW
AND THEN ONE SAW WOMEN AND GIRLS TURN AWAY WIPING THE TEARS FROM THEIR
EYES

IN FRONT OF THE KRANTZ IS AN OPEN SQUARE OVER THE WAY WAS THE CHURCH
WHERE THE FUNERAL SERVICES WOULD BE HELD IT IS SMALL AND OLD AND
SEVERELY PLAIN PLASTERED OUTSIDE AND WHITEWASHED OR PAINTED AND WITH
NO ORNAMENT BUT A STATUE OF A MONK IN A NICHE OVER THE DOOR AND ABOVE
THAT A SMALL BLACK FLAG BUT IN ITS CRYPT LIE SEVERAL OF THE GREAT DEAD
OF THE HOUSE OF HABSBURG AMONG THEM MARIA THERESA AND NAPOLEONS SON
THE DUKE OF REICHSTADT HEREABOUTS WAS A ROMAN CAMP ONCE AND IN IT
THE EMPEROR MARCUS AURELIUS DIED A THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE THE FIRST
HABSBURG RULED IN VIENNA WHICH WAS SIX HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND MORE

THE LITTLE CHURCH IS PACKED IN AMONG GREAT MODERN STORES AND HOUSES
AND THE WINDOWS OF THEM WERE FULL OF PEOPLE BEHIND THE VAST
PLATEGLASS WINDOWS OF THE UPPER FLOORS OF A HOUSE ON THE CORNER ONE
GLIMPSED TERRACED MASSES OF FINECLOTHED MEN AND WOMEN DIM AND
SHIMMERY LIKE PEOPLE UNDER WATER UNDER US THE SQUARE WAS NOISELESS
BUT IT WAS FULL OF CITIZENS OFFICIALS IN FINE UNIFORMS WERE FLITTING
ABOUT ON ERRANDS AND IN A DOORSTEP SAT A FIGURE IN THE UTTERMOST
RAGGEDNESS OF POVERTY THE FEET BARE THE HEAD BENT HUMBLY DOWN A
YOUTH OF EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY HE WAS AND THROUGH THE FIELDGLASS ONE
COULD SEE THAT HE WAS TEARING APART AND MUNCHING RIFFRAFF THAT HE HAD
GATHERED SOMEWHERE BLAZING UNIFORMS FLASHED BY HIM MAKING A SPARKLING
CONTRAST WITH HIS DROOPING RUIN OF MOLDY RAGS BUT HE TOOK NO NOTICE
HE WAS NOT THERE TO GRIEVE FOR A NATIONS DISASTER HE HAD HIS OWN
CARES AND DEEPER FROM TWO DIRECTIONS TWO LONG FILES OF INFANTRY CAME
PLOWING THROUGH THE PACK AND PRESS IN SILENCE THERE WAS A LOW CRISP
ORDER AND THE CROWD VANISHED THE SQUARE SAVE THE SIDEWALKS WAS EMPTY
THE PRIVATE MOURNER WAS GONE ANOTHER ORDER THE SOLDIERS FELL APART
AND ENCLOSED THE SQUARE IN A DOUBLERANKED HUMAN FENCE IT WAS ALL SO
SWIFT NOISELESS EXACTLIKE A BEAUTIFULLY ORDERED MACHINE

IT WAS NOON NOW TWO HOURS OF STILLNESS AND WAITING FOLLOWED THEN
CARRIAGES BEGAN TO FLOW PAST AND DELIVER THE TWO OR THREE HUNDRED COURT
PERSONAGES AND HIGH NOBILITIES PRIVILEGED TO ENTER THE CHURCH THEN THE
SQUARE FILLED UP NOT WITH CIVILIANS BUT WITH ARMY AND NAVY OFFICERS
IN SHOWY AND BEAUTIFUL UNIFORMS THEY FILLED IT COMPACTLY LEAVING ONLY
A NARROW CARRIAGE PATH IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH BUT THERE WAS NO
CIVILIAN AMONG THEM AND IT WAS BETTER SO DULL CLOTHES WOULD HAVE
MARRED THE RADIANT SPECTACLE IN THE JAM IN FRONT OF THE CHURCH ON ITS
STEPS AND ON THE SIDEWALK WAS A BUNCH OF UNIFORMS WHICH MADE A BLAZING
SPLOTCH OF COLORINTENSE RED GOLD AND WHITEWHICH DIMMED THE
BRILLIANCIES AROUND THEM AND OPPOSITE THEM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
PATH WAS A BUNCH OF CASCADED BRIGHTGREEN PLUMES ABOVE PALEBLUE
SHOULDERS WHICH MADE ANOTHER SPLOTCH OF SPLENDOR EMPHATIC AND
CONSPICUOUS IN ITS GLOWING SURROUNDINGS IT WAS A SEA OF FLASHING COLOR
ALL ABOUT BUT THESE TWO GROUPS WERE THE HIGH NOTES THE GREEN PLUMES
WERE WORN BY FORTY OR FIFTY AUSTRIAN GENERALS THE GROUP OPPOSITE THEM
WERE CHIEFLY KNIGHTS OF MALTA AND KNIGHTS OF A GERMAN ORDER THE MASS
OF HEADS IN THE SQUARE WERE COVERED BY GILT HELMETS AND BY MILITARY
CAPS ROOFED WITH A MIRRORLIKE GLAZE AND THE MOVEMENTS OF THE WEARERS
CAUSED THESE THINGS TO CATCH THE SUNRAYS AND THE EFFECT WAS FINE TO
SEETHE SQUARE WAS LIKE A GARDEN OF RICHLY COLORED FLOWERS WITH A
MULTITUDE OF BLINDING AND FLASHING LITTLE SUNS DISTRIBUTED OVER IT

THINK OF ITIT WAS BY COMMAND OF THAT ITALIAN LOAFER YONDER ON HIS
IMPERIAL THRONE IN THE GENEVA PRISON THAT THIS SPLENDID MULTITUDE WAS
ASSEMBLED THERE AND THE KINGS AND EMPERORS THAT WERE ENTERING THE
CHURCH FROM A SIDE STREET WERE THERE BY HIS WILL IT IS SO STRANGE SO
UNREALIZABLE

AT THREE OCLOCK THE CARRIAGES WERE STILL STREAMING BY IN SINGLE FILE
AT THREEFIVE A CARDINAL ARRIVES WITH HIS ATTENDANTS LATER SOME
BISHOPS THEN A NUMBER OF ARCHDEACONSALL IN STRIKING COLORS THAT ADD
TO THE SHOW AT THREETEN A PROCESSION OF PRIESTS PASSES ALONG WITH
CRUCIFIX ANOTHER ONE PRESENTLY AFTER AN INTERVAL TWO MORE AT
THREEFIFTY ANOTHER ONEVERY LONG WITH MANY CROSSES GOLDEMBROIDERED
ROBES AND MUCH WHITE LACE ALSO GREAT PICTURED BANNERS AT INTERVALS
RECEDING INTO THE DISTANCE

A HUM OF TOLLING BELLS MAKES ITSELF HEARD BUT NOT SHARPLY AT
THREEFIFTYEIGHT A WAITING INTERVAL PRESENTLY A LONG PROCESSION OF
GENTLEMEN IN EVENING DRESS COMES IN SIGHT AND APPROACHES UNTIL IT IS
NEAR TO THE SQUARE THEN FALLS BACK AGAINST THE WALL OF SOLDIERS AT THE
SIDEWALK AND THE WHITE SHIRTFRONTS SHOW LIKE SNOWFLAKES AND ARE VERY
CONSPICUOUS WHERE SO MUCH WARM COLOR IS ALL ABOUT

A WAITING PAUSE AT FOURTWELVE THE HEAD OF THE FUNERAL PROCESSION
COMES INTO VIEW AT LAST FIRST A BODY OF CAVALRY FOUR ABREAST TO
WIDEN THE PATH NEXT A GREAT BODY OF LANCERS IN BLUE WITH GILT
HELMETS NEXT THREE SIXHORSE MOURNINGCOACHES OUTRIDERS AND COACHMEN
IN BLACK WITH COCKED HATS AND WHITE WIGS NEXT TROOPS IN SPLENDID
UNIFORMS RED GOLD AND WHITE EXCEEDINGLY SHOWY

NOW THE MULTITUDE UNCOVER THE SOLDIERS PRESENT ARMS THERE IS A LOW
RUMBLE OF DRUMS THE SUMPTUOUS GREAT HEARSE APPROACHES DRAWN AT A WALK
BY EIGHT BLACK HORSES PLUMED WITH BLACK BUNCHES OF NODDING OSTRICH
FEATHERS THE COFFIN IS BORNE INTO THE CHURCH THE DOORS ARE CLOSED

THE MULTITUDE COVER THEIR HEADS AND THE REST OF THE PROCESSION MOVES
BY FIRST THE HUNGARIAN GUARD IN THEIR INDESCRIBABLY BRILLIANT AND
PICTURESQUE AND BEAUTIFUL UNIFORM INHERITED FROM THE AGES OF BARBARIC
SPLENDOR AND AFTER THEM OTHER MOUNTED FORCES A LONG AND SHOWY ARRAY

THEN THE SHINING CROWN IN THE SQUARE CRUMBLED APART A WRECKED RAINBOW
AND MELTED AWAY IN RADIANT STREAMS AND IN THE TURN OF A WRIST THE
THREE DIRTIEST AND RAGGEDEST AND CHEERFULEST LITTLE SLUMGIRLS IN
AUSTRIA WERE CAPERING ABOUT IN THE SPACIOUS VACANCY IT WAS A DAY OF
CONTRASTS

TWICE THE EMPRESS ENTERED VIENNA IN STATE THE FIRST TIME WAS IN
WHEN SHE WAS A BRIDE OF SEVENTEEN AND THEN SHE RODE IN MEASURELESS
POMP AND WITH BLARE OF MUSIC THROUGH A FLUTTERING WORLD OF GAY FLAGS
AND DECORATIONS DOWN STREETS WALLED ON BOTH HANDS WITH A PRESS OF
SHOUTING AND WELCOMING SUBJECTS AND THE SECOND TIME WAS LAST
WEDNESDAY WHEN SHE ENTERED THE CITY IN HER COFFIN AND MOVED DOWN THE
SAME STREETS IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT UNDER SWAYING BLACK FLAGS
BETWEEN PACKED HUMAN WALLS AGAIN BUT EVERYWHERE WAS A DEEP STILLNESS
NOWA STILLNESS EMPHASIZED RATHER THAN BROKEN BY THE MUFFLED
HOOFBEATS OF THE LONG CAVALCADE OVER PAVEMENTS CUSHIONED WITH SAND AND
THE LOW SOBBING OF GRAYHEADED WOMEN WHO HAD WITNESSED THE FIRST ENTRY
FORTYFOUR YEARS BEFORE WHEN SHE AND THEY WERE YOUNGAND UNAWARE

A CHARACTER IN BARON VON BERGERS RECENT FAIRY DRAMA HABSBURG TELLS
ABOUT THAT FIRST COMING OF THE GIRLISH EMPRESSQUEEN AND IN HIS
HISTORY DRAWS A FINE PICTURE I CANNOT MAKE A CLOSE TRANSLATION OF IT
BUT WILL TRY TO CONVEY THE SPIRIT OF THE VERSES

I SAW THE STATELY PAGEANT PASS
IN HER HIGH PLACE I SAW THE EMPRESSQUEEN
I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES AWAY
FROM THAT FAIR VISION SPIRITLIKE AND PURE
THAT ROSE SERENE SUBLIME AND FIGURED TO MY SENSE
A NOBLE ALP FAR LIGHTED IN THE BLUE
THAT IN THE FLOOD OF MORNING RENDS ITS VEIL OF CLOUD
AND STANDS A DREAM OF GLORY TO THE GAZE
OF THEM THAT IN THE VALLEY TOIL AND PLOD




A SCRAP OF CURIOUS HISTORY


MARION CITY ON THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER IN THE STATE OF MISSOURIA
VILLAGE TIME LA BOURBOULELESBAINS FRANCEA VILLAGE TIME
THE END OF JUNE I WAS IN THE ONE VILLAGE IN THAT EARLY TIME I
AM IN THE OTHER NOW THESE TIMES AND PLACES ARE SUFFICIENTLY WIDE
APART YET TODAY I HAVE THE STRANGE SENSE OF BEING THRUST BACK INTO
THAT MISSOURIAN VILLAGE AND OF RELIVING CERTAIN STIRRING DAYS THAT I
LIVED THERE SO LONG AGO

LAST SATURDAY NIGHT THE LIFE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC
WAS TAKEN BY AN ITALIAN ASSASSIN LAST NIGHT A MOB SURROUNDED OUR
HOTEL SHOUTING HOWLING SINGING THE MARSEILLAISE AND PELTING OUR
WINDOWS WITH STICKS AND STONES FOR WE HAVE ITALIAN WAITERS AND THE
MOB DEMANDED THAT THEY BE TURNED OUT OF THE HOUSE INSTANTLYTO BE
DRUBBED AND THEN DRIVEN OUT OF THE VILLAGE EVERYBODY IN THE HOTEL
REMAINED UP UNTIL FAR INTO THE NIGHT AND EXPERIENCED THE SEVERAL KINDS
OF TERROR WHICH ONE READS ABOUT IN BOOKS WHICH TELL OF NIGHT ATTACKS BY
ITALIANS AND BY FRENCH MOBS THE GROWING ROAR OF THE ONCOMING CROWD
THE ARRIVAL WITH RAIN OF STONES AND A CRASH OF GLASS THE WITHDRAWAL
TO REARRANGE PLANSFOLLOWED BY A SILENCE OMINOUS THREATENING AND
HARDER TO BEAR THAN EVEN THE ACTIVE SIEGE AND THE NOISE THE LANDLORD
AND THE TWO VILLAGE POLICEMEN STOOD THEIR GROUND AND AT LAST THE MOB
WAS PERSUADED TO GO AWAY AND LEAVE OUR ITALIANS IN PEACE TODAY FOUR OF
THE RINGLEADERS HAVE BEEN SENTENCED TO HEAVY PUNISHMENT OF A PUBLIC
SORTAND ARE BECOME LOCAL HEROES BY CONSEQUENCE

THAT IS THE VERY MISTAKE WHICH WAS AT FIRST MADE IN THE MISSOURIAN
VILLAGE HALF A CENTURY AGO THE MISTAKE WAS REPEATED AND REPEATEDJUST
AS FRANCE IS DOING IN THESE LATTER MONTHS

IN OUR VILLAGE WE HAD OUR RAVOCHALS OUR HENRYS OUR VAILLANTS AND IN
A HUMBLE WAY OUR CESARIOI HOPE I HAVE SPELLED THIS NAME WRONG FIFTY
YEARS AGO WE PASSED THROUGH IN ALL ESSENTIALS WHAT FRANCE HAS BEEN
PASSING THROUGH DURING THE PAST TWO OR THREE YEARS IN THE MATTER OF
PERIODICAL FRIGHTS HORRORS AND SHUDDERINGS

IN SEVERAL DETAILS THE PARALLELS ARE QUAINTLY EXACT IN THAT DAY FOR A
MAN TO SPEAK OUT OPENLY AND PROCLAIM HIMSELF AN ENEMY OF NEGRO SLAVERY
WAS SIMPLY TO PROCLAIM HIMSELF A MADMAN FOR HE WAS BLASPHEMING AGAINST
THE HOLIEST THING KNOWN TO A MISSOURIAN AND COULD NOT BE IN HIS RIGHT
MIND FOR A MAN TO PROCLAIM HIMSELF AN ANARCHIST IN FRANCE THREE YEARS
AGO WAS TO PROCLAIM HIMSELF A MADMANHE COULD NOT BE IN HIS RIGHT
MIND

NOW THE ORIGINAL OLD FIRST BLASPHEMER AGAINST ANY INSTITUTION
PROFOUNDLY VENERATED BY A COMMUNITY IS QUITE SURE TO BE IN EARNEST HIS
FOLLOWERS AND IMITATORS MAY BE HUMBUGS AND SELFSEEKERS BUT HE HIMSELF
IS SINCEREHIS HEART IS IN HIS PROTEST

ROBERT HARDY WAS OUR FIRST ABOLITIONISTAWFUL NAME HE WAS A
JOURNEYMAN COOPER AND WORKED IN THE BIG COOPERSHOP BELONGING TO THE
GREAT PORKPACKING ESTABLISHMENT WHICH WAS MARION CITYS CHIEF PRIDE
AND SOLE SOURCE OF PROSPERITY HE WAS A NEWENGLANDER A STRANGER AND
BEING A STRANGER HE WAS OF COURSE REGARDED AS AN INFERIOR PERSONFOR
THAT HAS BEEN HUMAN NATURE FROM ADAM DOWNAND OF COURSE ALSO HE WAS
MADE TO FEEL UNWELCOME FOR THIS IS THE ANCIENT LAW WITH MAN AND THE
OTHER ANIMALS HARDY WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD AND A BACHELOR PALE GIVEN
TO REVERIE AND READING HE WAS RESERVED AND SEEMED TO PREFER THE
ISOLATION WHICH HAD FALLEN TO HIS LOT HE WAS TREATED TO MANY SIDE
REMARKS BY HIS FELLOWS BUT AS HE DID NOT RESENT THEM IT WAS DECIDED
THAT HE WAS A COWARD

ALL OF A SUDDEN HE PROCLAIMED HIMSELF AN ABOLITIONISTSTRAIGHT OUT AND
PUBLICLY HE SAID THAT NEGRO SLAVERY WAS A CRIME AN INFAMY FOR A
MOMENT THE TOWN WAS PARALYZED WITH ASTONISHMENT THEN IT BROKE INTO A
FURY OF RAGE AND SWARMED TOWARD THE COOPERSHOP TO LYNCH HARDY BUT THE
METHODIST MINISTER MADE A POWERFUL SPEECH TO THEM AND STAYED THEIR
HANDS HE PROVED TO THEM THAT HARDY WAS INSANE AND NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR
HIS WORDS THAT NO MAN COULD BE SANE AND UTTER SUCH WORDS

SO HARDY WAS SAVED BEING INSANE HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO ON TALKING HE
WAS FOUND TO BE GOOD ENTERTAINMENT SEVERAL NIGHTS RUNNING HE MADE
ABOLITION SPEECHES IN THE OPEN AIR AND ALL THE TOWN FLOCKED TO HEAR
AND LAUGH HE IMPLORED THEM TO BELIEVE HIM SANE AND SINCERE AND HAVE
PITY ON THE POOR SLAVES AND TAKE MEASURES FOR THE RESTORATION OF THEIR
STOLEN RIGHTS OR IN NO LONG TIME BLOOD WOULD FLOWBLOOD BLOOD RIVERS
OF BLOOD

IT WAS GREAT FUN BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THE ASPECT OF THINGS CHANGED A
SLAVE CAME FLYING FROM PALMYRA THE COUNTYSEAT A FEW MILES BACK AND
WAS ABOUT TO ESCAPE IN A CANOE TO ILLINOIS AND FREEDOM IN THE DULL
TWILIGHT OF THE APPROACHING DAWN WHEN THE TOWN CONSTABLE SEIZED HIM
HARDY HAPPENED ALONG AND TRIED TO RESCUE THE NEGRO THERE WAS A
STRUGGLE AND THE CONSTABLE DID NOT COME OUT OF IT ALIVE HARDY CROSSED
THE RIVER WITH THE NEGRO AND THEN CAME BACK TO GIVE HIMSELF UP ALL
THIS TOOK TIME FOR THE MISSISSIPPI IS NOT A FRENCH BROOK LIKE THE
SEINE THE LOIRE AND THOSE OTHER RIVULETS BUT IS A REAL RIVER NEARLY
A MILE WIDE THE TOWN WAS ON HAND IN FORCE BY NOW BUT THE METHODIST
PREACHER AND THE SHERIFF HAD ALREADY MADE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE INTEREST
OF ORDER SO HARDY WAS SURROUNDED BY A STRONG GUARD AND SAFELY CONVEYED
TO THE VILLAGE CALABOOSE IN SPITE OF ALL THE EFFORT OF THE MOB TO GET
HOLD OF HIM THE READER WILL HAVE BEGUN TO PERCEIVE THAT THIS METHODIST
MINISTER WAS A PROMPT MAN A PROMPT MAN WITH ACTIVE HANDS AND A GOOD
HEADPIECE WILLIAMS WAS HIS NAMEDAMON WILLIAMS DAMON WILLIAMS IN
PUBLIC DAMNATION WILLIAMS IN PRIVATE BECAUSE HE WAS SO POWERFUL ON
THAT THEME AND SO FREQUENT

THE EXCITEMENT WAS PRODIGIOUS THE CONSTABLE WAS THE FIRST MAN WHO HAD
EVER BEEN KILLED IN THE TOWN THE EVENT WAS BY LONG ODDS THE MOST
IMPOSING IN THE TOWNS HISTORY IT LIFTED THE HUMBLE VILLAGE INTO
SUDDEN IMPORTANCE ITS NAME WAS IN EVERYBODYS MOUTH FOR TWENTY MILES
AROUND AND SO WAS THE NAME OF ROBERT HARDYROBERT HARDY THE STRANGER
THE DESPISED IN A DAY HE WAS BECOME THE PERSON OF MOST CONSEQUENCE IN
THE REGION THE ONLY PERSON TALKED ABOUT AS TO THOSE OTHER COOPERS
THEY FOUND THEIR POSITION CURIOUSLY CHANGEDTHEY WERE IMPORTANT PEOPLE
OR UNIMPORTANT NOW IN PROPORTION AS TO HOW LARGE OR HOW SMALL HAD
BEEN THEIR INTERCOURSE WITH THE NEW CELEBRITY THE TWO OR THREE WHO HAD
REALLY BEEN ON A SORT OF FAMILIAR FOOTING WITH HIM FOUND THEMSELVES
OBJECTS OF ADMIRING INTEREST WITH THE PUBLIC AND OF ENVY WITH THEIR
SHOPMATES

THE VILLAGE WEEKLY JOURNAL HAD LATELY GONE INTO NEW HANDS THE NEW MAN
WAS AN ENTERPRISING FELLOW AND HE MADE THE MOST OF THE TRAGEDY HE
ISSUED AN EXTRA THEN HE PUT UP POSTERS PROMISING TO DEVOTE HIS WHOLE
PAPER TO MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE GREAT EVENTTHERE WOULD BE A FULL
AND INTENSELY INTERESTING BIOGRAPHY OF THE MURDERER AND EVEN A
PORTRAIT OF HIM HE WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD HE CARVED THE PORTRAIT
HIMSELF ON THE BACK OF A WOODEN TYPEAND A TERROR IT WAS TO LOOK AT
IT MADE A GREAT COMMOTION FOR THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THE VILLAGE
PAPER HAD EVER CONTAINED A PICTURE THE VILLAGE WAS VERY PROUD THE
OUTPUT OF THE PAPER WAS TEN TIMES AS GREAT AS IT HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
YET EVERY COPY WAS SOLD

WHEN THE TRIAL CAME ON PEOPLE CAME FROM ALL THE FARMS AROUND AND FROM
HANNIBAL AND QUINCY AND EVEN FROM KEOKUK AND THE COURTHOUSE COULD
HOLD ONLY A FRACTION OF THE CROWD THAT APPLIED FOR ADMISSION THE TRIAL
WAS PUBLISHED IN THE VILLAGE PAPER WITH FRESH AND STILL MORE TRYING
PICTURES OF THE ACCUSED

HARDY WAS CONVICTED AND HANGEDA MISTAKE PEOPLE CAME FROM MILES
AROUND TO SEE THE HANGING THEY BROUGHT CAKES AND CIDER ALSO THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN AND MADE A PICNIC OF THE MATTER IT WAS THE LARGEST CROWD
THE VILLAGE HAD EVER SEEN THE ROPE THAT HANGED HARDY WAS EAGERLY
BOUGHT UP IN INCH SAMPLES FOR EVERYBODY WANTED A MEMENTO OF THE
MEMORABLE EVENT

MARTYRDOM GILDED WITH NOTORIETY HAS ITS FASCINATIONS WITHIN ONE WEEK
AFTERWARD FOUR YOUNG LIGHTWEIGHTS IN THE VILLAGE PROCLAIMED THEMSELVES
ABOLITIONISTS IN LIFE HARDY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A CONVERT
EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM BUT NOBODY COULD LAUGH AT HIS LEGACY THE
FOUR SWAGGERED AROUND WITH THEIR SLOUCHHATS PULLED DOWN OVER THEIR
FACES AND HINTED DARKLY AT AWFUL POSSIBILITIES THE PEOPLE WERE
TROUBLED AND AFRAID AND SHOWED IT AND THEY WERE STUNNED TOO THEY
COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT ABOLITIONIST HAD ALWAYS BEEN A TERM OF SHAME
AND HORROR YET HERE WERE FOUR YOUNG MEN WHO WERE NOT ONLY NOT ASHAMED
TO BEAR THAT NAME BUT WERE GRIMLY PROUD OF IT RESPECTABLE YOUNG MEN
THEY WERE TOOOF GOOD FAMILIES AND BROUGHT UP IN THE CHURCH ED
SMITH THE PRINTERS APPRENTICE NINETEEN HAD BEEN THE HEAD
SUNDAYSCHOOL BOY AND HAD ONCE RECITED THREE THOUSAND BIBLE VERSES
WITHOUT MAKING A BREAK DICK SAVAGE TWENTY THE BAKERS APPRENTICE
WILL JOYCE TWENTYTWO JOURNEYMAN BLACKSMITH AND HENRY TAYLOR
TWENTYFOUR TOBACCOSTEMMERWERE THE OTHER THREE THEY WERE ALL OF A
SENTIMENTAL CAST THEY WERE ALL ROMANCEREADERS THEY ALL WROTE POETRY
SUCH AS IT WAS THEY WERE ALL VAIN AND FOOLISH BUT THEY HAD NEVER
BEFORE BEEN SUSPECTED OF HAVING ANYTHING BAD IN THEM

THEY WITHDREW FROM SOCIETY AND GREW MORE AND MORE MYSTERIOUS AND
DREADFUL THEY PRESENTLY ACHIEVED THE DISTINCTION OF BEING DENOUNCED BY
NAMES FROM THE PULPITWHICH MADE AN IMMENSE STIR THIS WAS GRANDEUR
THIS WAS FAME THEY WERE ENVIED BY ALL THE OTHER YOUNG FELLOWS NOW
THIS WAS NATURAL THEIR COMPANY GREWGREW ALARMINGLY THEY TOOK A NAME
IT WAS A SECRET NAME AND WAS DIVULGED TO NO OUTSIDER PUBLICLY THEY
WERE SIMPLY THE ABOLITIONISTS THEY HAD PASSWORDS GRIPS AND SIGNS
THEY HAD SECRET MEETINGS THEIR INITIATIONS WERE CONDUCTED WITH GLOOMY
POMPS AND CEREMONIES AT MIDNIGHT

THEY ALWAYS SPOKE OF HARDY AS THE MARTYR AND EVERY LITTLE WHILE THEY
MOVED THROUGH THE PRINCIPAL STREET IN PROCESSIONAT MIDNIGHT
BLACKROBED MASKED TO THE MEASURED TAP OF THE SOLEMN DRUMON
PILGRIMAGE TO THE MARTYRS GRAVE WHERE THEY WENT THROUGH WITH SOME
MAJESTIC FOOLERIES AND SWORE VENGEANCE UPON HIS MURDERERS THEY GAVE
PREVIOUS NOTICE OF THE PILGRIMAGE BY SMALL POSTERS AND WARNED
EVERYBODY TO KEEP INDOORS AND DARKEN ALL HOUSES ALONG THE ROUTE AND
LEAVE THE ROAD EMPTY THESE WARNINGS WERE OBEYED FOR THERE WAS A SKULL
AND CROSSBONES AT THE TOP OF THE POSTER

WHEN THIS KIND OF THING HAD BEEN GOING ON ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS A QUITE
NATURAL THING HAPPENED A FEW MEN OF CHARACTER AND GRIT WOKE UP OUT OF
THE NIGHTMARE OF FEAR WHICH HAD BEEN STUPEFYING THEIR FACULTIES AND
BEGAN TO DISCHARGE SCORN AND SCOFFINGS AT THEMSELVES AND THE COMMUNITY
FOR ENDURING THIS CHILDSPLAY AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY PROPOSED TO
END IT STRAIGHTWAY EVERYBODY FELT AN UPLIFT LIFE WAS BREATHED INTO
THEIR DEAD SPIRITS THEIR COURAGE ROSE AND THEY BEGAN TO FEEL LIKE MEN
AGAIN THIS WAS ON A SATURDAY ALL DAY THE NEW FEELING GREW AND
STRENGTHENED IT GREW WITH A RUSH IT BROUGHT INSPIRATION AND CHEER
WITH IT MIDNIGHT SAW A UNITED COMMUNITY FULL OF ZEAL AND PLUCK AND
WITH A CLEARLY DEFINED AND WELCOME PIECE OF WORK IN FRONT OF IT THE
BEST ORGANIZER AND STRONGEST AND BITTEREST TALKER ON THAT GREAT
SATURDAY WAS THE PRESBYTERIAN CLERGYMAN WHO HAD DENOUNCED THE ORIGINAL
FOUR FROM HIS PULPITREV HIRAM FLETCHERAND HE PROMISED TO USE HIS
PULPIT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST AGAIN NOW ON THE MORROW HE HAD
REVELATIONS TO MAKE HE SAIDSECRETS OF THE DREADFUL SOCIETY

BUT THE REVELATIONS WERE NEVER MADE AT HALF PAST TWO IN THE MORNING
THE DEAD SILENCE OF THE VILLAGE WAS BROKEN BY A CRASHING EXPLOSION AND
THE TOWN PATROL SAW THE PREACHERS HOUSE SPRING IN A WRECK OF WHIRLING
FRAGMENTS INTO THE SKY THE PREACHER WAS KILLED TOGETHER WITH A NEGRO
WOMAN HIS ONLY SLAVE AND SERVANT

THE TOWN WAS PARALYZED AGAIN AND WITH REASON TO STRUGGLE AGAINST A
VISIBLE ENEMY IS A THING WORTH WHILE AND THERE IS A PLENTY OF MEN WHO
STAND ALWAYS READY TO UNDERTAKE IT BUT TO STRUGGLE AGAINST AN
INVISIBLE ONEAN INVISIBLE ONE WHO SNEAKS IN AND DOES HIS AWFUL WORK IN
THE DARK AND LEAVES NO TRACETHAT IS ANOTHER MATTER THAT IS A THING TO
MAKE THE BRAVEST TREMBLE AND HOLD BACK

THE COWED POPULACE WERE AFRAID TO GO TO THE FUNERAL THE MAN WHO WAS TO
HAVE HAD A PACKED CHURCH TO HEAR HIM EXPOSE AND DENOUNCE THE COMMON
ENEMY HAD BUT A HANDFUL TO SEE HIM BURIED THE CORONERS JURY HAD
BROUGHT IN A VERDICT OF DEATH BY THE VISITATION OF GOD FOR NO
WITNESS CAME FORWARD IF ANY EXISTED THEY PRUDENTLY KEPT OUT OF THE
WAY NOBODY SEEMED SORRY NOBODY WANTED TO SEE THE TERRIBLE SECRET
SOCIETY PROVOKED INTO THE COMMISSION OF FURTHER OUTRAGES EVERYBODY
WANTED THE TRAGEDY HUSHED UP IGNORED FORGOTTEN IF POSSIBLE

AND SO THERE WAS A BITTER SURPRISE AND AN UNWELCOME ONE WHEN WILL
JOYCE THE BLACKSMITHS JOURNEYMAN CAME OUT AND PROCLAIMED HIMSELF THE
ASSASSIN PLAINLY HE WAS NOT MINDED TO BE ROBBED OF HIS GLORY HE MADE
HIS PROCLAMATION AND STUCK TO IT STUCK TO IT AND INSISTED UPON A
TRIAL HERE WAS AN OMINOUS THING HERE WAS A NEW AND PECULIARLY
FORMIDABLE TERROR FOR A MOTIVE WAS REVEALED HERE WHICH SOCIETY COULD
NOT HOPE TO DEAL WITH SUCCESSFULLYVANITY THIRST FOR NOTORIETY IF
MEN WERE GOING TO KILL FOR NOTORIETYS SAKE AND TO WIN THE GLORY OF
NEWSPAPER RENOWN A BIG TRIAL AND A SHOWY EXECUTION WHAT POSSIBLE
INVENTION OF MAN COULD DISCOURAGE OR DETER THEM THE TOWN WAS IN A SORT
OF PANIC IT DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO

HOWEVER THE GRAND JURY HAD TO TAKE HOLD OF THE MATTERIT HAD NO
CHOICE IT BROUGHT IN A TRUE BILL AND PRESENTLY THE CASE WENT TO THE
COUNTY COURT THE TRIAL WAS A FINE SENSATION THE PRISONER WAS THE
PRINCIPAL WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION HE GAVE A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE
ASSASSINATION HE FURNISHED EVEN THE MINUTEST PARTICULARS HOW HE
DEPOSITED HIS KEG OF POWDER AND LAID HIS TRAINFROM THE HOUSE TO
SUCHANDSUCH A SPOT HOW GEORGE RONALDS AND HENRY HART CAME ALONG JUST
THEN SMOKING AND HE BORROWED HARTS CIGAR AND FIRED THE TRAIN WITH
IT SHOUTING DOWN WITH ALL SLAVETYRANTS AND HOW HART AND RONALDS
MADE NO EFFORT TO CAPTURE HIM BUT RAN AWAY AND HAD NEVER COME FORWARD
TO TESTIFY YET

BUT THEY HAD TO TESTIFY NOW AND THEY DIDAND PITIFUL IT WAS TO SEE HOW
RELUCTANT THEY WERE AND HOW SCARED THE CROWDED HOUSE LISTENED TO
JOYCES FEARFUL TALE WITH A PROFOUND AND BREATHLESS INTEREST AND IN A
DEEP HUSH WHICH WAS NOT BROKEN TILL HE BROKE IT HIMSELF IN CONCLUDING
WITH A ROARING REPETITION OF HIS DEATH TO ALL SLAVETYRANTSWHICH
CAME SO UNEXPECTEDLY AND SO STARTLINGLY THAT IT MADE EVERYONE PRESENT
CATCH HIS BREATH AND GASP

THE TRIAL WAS PUT IN THE PAPER WITH BIOGRAPHY AND LARGE PORTRAIT WITH
OTHER SLANDEROUS AND INSANE PICTURES AND THE EDITION SOLD BEYOND
IMAGINATION

THE EXECUTION OF JOYCE WAS A FINE AND PICTURESQUE THING IT DREW A VAST
CROWD GOOD PLACES IN TREES AND SEATS ON RAIL FENCES SOLD FOR HALF A
DOLLAR APIECE LEMONADE AND GINGERBREADSTANDS HAD GREAT PROSPERITY
JOYCE RECITED A FURIOUS AND FANTASTIC AND DENUNCIATORY SPEECH ON THE
SCAFFOLD WHICH HAD IMPOSING PASSAGES OF SCHOOLBOY ELOQUENCE IN IT AND
GAVE HIM A REPUTATION ON THE SPOT AS AN ORATOR AND HIS NAME LATER IN
THE SOCIETYS RECORDS OF THE MARTYR ORATOR HE WENT TO HIS DEATH
BREATHING SLAUGHTER AND CHARGING HIS SOCIETY TO AVENGE HIS MURDER IF
HE KNEW ANYTHING OF HUMAN NATURE HE KNEW THAT TO PLENTY OF YOUNG
FELLOWS PRESENT IN THAT GREAT CROWD HE WAS A GRAND HEROAND ENVIABLY
SITUATED

HE WAS HANGED IT WAS A MISTAKE WITHIN A MONTH FROM HIS DEATH THE
SOCIETY WHICH HE HAD HONORED HAD TWENTY NEW MEMBERS SOME OF THEM
EARNEST DETERMINED MEN THEY DID NOT COURT DISTINCTION IN THE SAME
WAY BUT THEY CELEBRATED HIS MARTYRDOM THE CRIME WHICH HAD BEEN
OBSCURE AND DESPISED HAD BECOME LOFTY AND GLORIFIED

SUCH THINGS WERE HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WILDBRAINED MARTYRDOM
WAS SUCCEEDED BY UPRISING AND ORGANIZATION THEN IN NATURAL ORDER
FOLLOWED RIOT INSURRECTION AND THE WRACK AND RESTITUTIONS OF WAR IT
WAS BOUND TO COME AND IT WOULD NATURALLY COME IN THAT WAY IT HAS BEEN
THE MANNER OF REFORM SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD




SWITZERLAND THE CRADLE OF LIBERTY


INTERLAKEN SWITZERLAND

IT IS A GOOD MANY YEARS SINCE I WAS IN SWITZERLAND LAST IN THAT REMOTE
TIME THERE WAS ONLY ONE LADDER RAILWAY IN THE COUNTRY THAT STATE OF
THINGS IS ALL CHANGED THERE ISNT A MOUNTAIN IN SWITZERLAND NOW THAT
HASNT A LADDER RAILROAD OR TWO UP ITS BACK LIKE SUSPENDERS INDEED
SOME MOUNTAINS ARE LATTICED WITH THEM AND TWO YEARS HENCE ALL WILL BE
IN THAT DAY THE PEASANT OF THE HIGH ALTITUDES WILL HAVE TO CARRY A
LANTERN WHEN HE GOES VISITING IN THE NIGHT TO KEEP FROM STUMBLING OVER
RAILROADS THAT HAVE BEEN BUILT SINCE HIS LAST ROUND AND ALSO IN THAT
DAY IF THERE SHALL REMAIN A HIGHALTITUDE PEASANT WHOSE POTATOPATCH
HASNT A RAILROAD THROUGH IT IT WILL MAKE HIM AS CONSPICUOUS AS
WILLIAM TELL

HOWEVER THERE ARE ONLY TWO BEST WAYS TO TRAVEL THROUGH SWITZERLAND
THE FIRST BEST IS AFOOT THE SECOND BEST IS BY OPEN TWOHORSE CARRIAGE
ONE CAN COME FROM LUCERNE TO INTERLAKEN OVER THE BRUNIG BY LADDER
RAILROAD IN AN HOUR OR SO NOW BUT YOU CAN GLIDE SMOOTHLY IN A CARRIAGE
IN TEN AND HAVE TWO HOURS FOR LUNCHEON AT NOONFOR LUNCHEON NOT FOR
REST THERE IS NO FATIGUE CONNECTED WITH THE TRIP ONE ARRIVES FRESH IN
SPIRIT AND IN PERSON IN THE EVENINGNO FRET IN HIS HEART NO GRIME ON
HIS FACE NO GRIT IN HIS HAIR NOT A CINDER IN HIS EYE THIS IS THE
RIGHT CONDITION OF MIND AND BODY THE RIGHT AND DUE PREPARATION FOR THE
SOLEMN EVENT WHICH CLOSED THE DAYSTEPPING WITH METAPHORICALLY
UNCOVERED HEAD INTO THE PRESENCE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE MOUNTAIN MASS
THAT THE GLOBE CAN SHOWTHE JUNGFRAU THE STRANGERS FIRST FEELING
WHEN SUDDENLY CONFRONTED BY THAT TOWERING AND AWFUL APPARITION WRAPPED
IN ITS SHROUD OF SNOW IS BREATHTAKING ASTONISHMENT IT IS AS IF
HEAVENS GATES HAD SWUNG OPEN AND EXPOSED THE THRONE

IT IS PEACEFUL HERE AND PLEASANT AT INTERLAKEN NOTHING GOING ONAT
LEAST NOTHING BUT BRILLIANT LIFEGIVING SUNSHINE THERE ARE FLOODS AND
FLOODS OF THAT ONE MAY PROPERLY SPEAK OF IT AS GOING ON FOR IT IS
FULL OF THE SUGGESTION OF ACTIVITY THE LIGHT POURS DOWN WITH ENERGY
WITH VISIBLE ENTHUSIASM THIS IS A GOOD ATMOSPHERE TO BE IN MORALLY AS
WELL AS PHYSICALLY AFTER TRYING THE POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE OF THE
NEIGHBORING MONARCHIES IT IS HEALING AND REFRESHING TO BREATHE IN AIR
THAT HAS KNOWN NO TAINT OF SLAVERY FOR SIX HUNDRED YEARS AND TO COME
AMONG A PEOPLE WHOSE POLITICAL HISTORY IS GREAT AND FINE AND WORTHY TO
BE TAUGHT IN ALL SCHOOLS AND STUDIED BY ALL RACES AND PEOPLES FOR THE
STRUGGLE HERE THROUGHOUT THE CENTURIES HAS NOT BEEN IN THE INTEREST OF
ANY PRIVATE FAMILY OR ANY CHURCH BUT IN THE INTEREST OF THE WHOLE
BODY OF THE NATION AND FOR SHELTER AND PROTECTION OF ALL FORMS OF
BELIEF THIS FACT IS COLOSSAL IF ONE WOULD REALIZE HOW COLOSSAL IT IS
AND OF WHAT DIGNITY AND MAJESTY LET HIM CONTRAST IT WITH THE PURPOSES
AND OBJECTS OF THE CRUSADES THE SIEGE OF YORK THE WAR OF THE ROSES
AND OTHER HISTORIC COMEDIES OF THAT SORT AND SIZE

LAST WEEK I WAS BEATING AROUND THE LAKE OF FOUR CANTONS AND I SAW
RUTLI AND ALTORF RUTLI IS A REMOTE LITTLE PATCH OF A MEADOW BUT I DO
NOT KNOW HOW ANY PIECE OF GROUND COULD BE HOLIER OR BETTER WORTH
CROSSING OCEANS AND CONTINENTS TO SEE SINCE IT WAS THERE THAT THE
GREAT TRINITY OF SWITZERLAND JOINED HANDS SIX CENTURIES AGO AND SWORE
THE OATH WHICH SET THEIR ENSLAVED AND INSULTED COUNTRY FOREVER FREE
AND ALTORF IS ALSO HONORABLE GROUND AND WORSHIPFUL SINCE IT WAS THERE
THAT WILLIAM SURNAMED TELL WHICH INTERPRETED MEANS THE FOOLISH
TALKERTHAT IS TO SAY THE TOODARING TALKER REFUSED TO BOW TO
GESSLERS HAT OF LATE YEARS THE PRYING STUDENT OF HISTORY HAS BEEN
DELIGHTING HIMSELF BEYOND MEASURE OVER A WONDERFUL FIND WHICH HE HAS
MADETO WIT THAT TELL DID NOT SHOOT THE APPLE FROM HIS SONS HEAD TO
HEAR THE STUDENTS JUBILATE ONE WOULD SUPPOSE THAT THE QUESTION OF
WHETHER TELL SHOT THE APPLE OR DIDNT WAS AN IMPORTANT MATTER WHEREAS
IT RANKS IN IMPORTANCE EXACTLY WITH THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WASHINGTON
CHOPPED DOWN THE CHERRYTREE OR DIDNT THE DEEDS OF WASHINGTON THE
PATRIOT ARE THE ESSENTIAL THING THE CHERRYTREE INCIDENT IS OF NO
CONSEQUENCE TO PROVE THAT TELL DID SHOOT THE APPLE FROM HIS SONS HEAD
WOULD MERELY PROVE THAT HE HAD BETTER NERVE THAN MOST MEN AND WAS AS
SKILLFUL WITH A BOW AS A MILLION OTHERS WHO PRECEDED AND FOLLOWED HIM
BUT NOT ONE WHIT MORE SO BUT TELL WAS MORE AND BETTER THAN A MERE
MARKSMAN MORE AND BETTER THAN A MERE COOL HEAD HE WAS A TYPE HE
STANDS FOR SWISS PATRIOTISM IN HIS PERSON WAS REPRESENTED A WHOLE
PEOPLE HIS SPIRIT WAS THEIR SPIRITTHE SPIRIT WHICH WOULD BOW TO NONE
BUT GOD THE SPIRIT WHICH SAID THIS IN WORDS AND CONFIRMED IT WITH
DEEDS THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN TELLS IN SWITZERLANDPEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT
BOW THERE WAS A SUFFICIENCY OF THEM AT RUTLI THERE WERE PLENTY OF
THEM AT MURTEN PLENTY AT GRANDSON THERE ARE PLENTY TODAY AND THE
FIRST OF THEM ALLTHE VERY FIRST EARLIEST BANNERBEARER OF HUMAN
FREEDOM IN THIS WORLDWAS NOT A MAN BUT A WOMANSTAUFFACHERS WIFE
THERE SHE LOOMS DIM AND GREAT THROUGH THE HAZE OF THE CENTURIES
DELIVERING INTO HER HUSBANDS EAR THAT GOSPEL OF REVOLT WHICH WAS TO
BEAR FRUIT IN THE CONSPIRACY OF RUTLI AND THE BIRTH OF THE FIRST FREE
GOVERNMENT THE WORLD HAD EVER SEEN

FROM THIS VICTORIA HOTEL ONE LOOKS STRAIGHT ACROSS A FLAT OF TRIFLING
WIDTH TO A LOFTY MOUNTAIN BARRIER WHICH HAS A GATEWAY IN IT SHAPED
LIKE AN INVERTED PYRAMID BEYOND THIS GATEWAY ARISES THE VAST BULK OF
THE JUNGFRAU A SPOTLESS MASS OF GLEAMING SNOW INTO THE SKY THE
GATEWAY IN THE DARKCOLORED BARRIER MAKES A STRONG FRAME FOR THE
GREAT PICTURE THE SOMBER FRAME AND THE GLOWING SNOWPILE ARE
STARTLINGLY CONTRASTED IT IS THIS FRAME WHICH CONCENTRATES AND
EMPHASIZES THE GLORY OF THE JUNGFRAU AND MAKES IT THE MOST ENGAGING AND
BEGUILING AND FASCINATING SPECTACLE THAT EXISTS ON THE EARTH THERE ARE
MANY MOUNTAINS OF SNOW THAT ARE AS LOFTY AS THE JUNGFRAU AND AS NOBLY
PROPORTIONED BUT THEY LACK THE FRAME THEY STAND AT LARGE THEY ARE
INTRUDED UPON AND ELBOWED BY NEIGHBORING DOMES AND SUMMITS AND THEIR
GRANDEUR IS DIMINISHED AND FAILS OF EFFECT

IT IS A GOOD NAME JUNGFRAUVIRGIN NOTHING COULD BE WHITER NOTHING
COULD BE PURER NOTHING COULD BE SAINTLIER OF ASPECT AT SIX YESTERDAY
EVENING THE GREAT INTERVENING BARRIER SEEN THROUGH A FAINT BLUISH HAZE
SEEMED MADE OF AIR AND SUBSTANCELESS SO SOFT AND RICH IT WAS SO
SHIMMERING WHERE THE WANDERING LIGHTS TOUCHED IT AND SO DIM WHERE THE
SHADOWS LAY APPARENTLY IT WAS A DREAM STUFF A WORK OF THE
IMAGINATION NOTHING REAL ABOUT IT THE TINT WAS GREEN SLIGHTLY
VARYING SHADES OF IT BUT MAINLY VERY DARK THE SUN WAS DOWNAS FAR AS
THAT BARRIER WAS CONCERNED BUT NOT FOR THE JUNGFRAU TOWERING INTO THE
HEAVENS BEYOND THE GATEWAY SHE WAS A ROARING CONFLAGRATION OF BLINDING
WHITE

IT IS SAID THE FRIDOLIN THE OLD FRIDOLIN A NEW SAINT BUT FORMERLY A
MISSIONARY GAVE THE MOUNTAIN ITS GRACIOUS NAME HE WAS AN IRISHMAN
SON OF AN IRISH KINGTHERE WERE THIRTY THOUSAND KINGS REIGNING IN
COUNTY CORK ALONE IN HIS TIME FIFTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO IT GOT SO
THAT THEY COULD NOT MAKE A LIVING THERE WAS SO MUCH COMPETITION AND
WAGES GOT CUT SO SOME OF THEM WERE OUT OF WORK MONTHS AT A TIME WITH
WIFE AND LITTLE CHILDREN TO FEED AND NOT A CRUST IN THE PLACE AT LAST
A PARTICULARLY SEVERE WINTER FELL UPON THE COUNTRY AND HUNDREDS OF
THEM WERE REDUCED TO MENDICANCY AND WERE TO BE SEEN DAY AFTER DAY IN
THE BITTEREST WEATHER STANDING BAREFOOT IN THE SNOW HOLDING OUT THEIR
CROWNS FOR ALMS INDEED THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO EMIGRATE OR
STARVE BUT FOR A FORTUNATE IDEA OF PRINCE FRIDOLINS WHO STARTED A
LABORUNION THE FIRST ONE IN HISTORY AND GOT THE GREAT BULK OF THEM
TO JOIN IT HE THUS WON THE GENERAL GRATITUDE AND THEY WANTED TO MAKE
HIM EMPEROREMPEROR OVER THEM ALLEMPEROR OF COUNTY CORK BUT HE SAID
NO WALKING DELEGATE WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR HIM FOR BEHOLD HE WAS MODEST
BEYOND HIS YEARS AND KEEN AS A WHIP TO THIS DAY IN GERMANY AND
SWITZERLAND WHERE ST FRIDOLIN IS REVERED AND HONORED THE PEASANTRY
SPEAK OF HIM AFFECTIONATELY AS THE FIRST WALKING DELEGATE

THE FIRST WALK HE TOOK WAS INTO FRANCE AND GERMANY MISSIONARYINGFOR
MISSIONARYING WAS A BETTER THING IN THOSE DAYS THAN IT IS IN OURS ALL
YOU HAD TO DO WAS TO CURE THE HEAD SAVAGES SICK DAUGHTER BY A
MIRACLEA MIRACLE LIKE THE MIRACLE OF LOURDES IN OUR DAY FOR
INSTANCEAND IMMEDIATELY THAT HEAD SAVAGE WAS YOUR CONVERT AND FILLED
TO THE EYES WITH A NEW CONVERTS ENTHUSIASM YOU COULD SIT DOWN AND
MAKE YOURSELF EASY NOW HE WOULD TAKE AN AX AND CONVERT THE REST OF
THE NATION HIMSELF CHARLEMAGNE WAS THAT KIND OF A WALKING DELEGATE

YES THERE WERE GREAT MISSIONARIES IN THOSE DAYS FOR THE METHODS WERE
SURE AND THE REWARDS GREAT WE HAVE NO SUCH MISSIONARIES NOW AND NO
SUCH METHODS

BUT TO CONTINUE THE HISTORY OF THE FIRST WALKING DELEGATE IF YOU ARE
INTERESTED I AM INTERESTED MYSELF BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN HIS RELICS IN
SACKINGEN AND ALSO THE VERY SPOT WHERE HE WORKED HIS GREAT MIRACLETHE
ONE WHICH WON HIM HIS SAINTHOOD IN THE PAPAL COURT A FEW CENTURIES
LATER TO HAVE SEEN THESE THINGS MAKES ME FEEL VERY NEAR TO HIM ALMOST
LIKE A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY IN FACT WHILE WANDERING ABOUT THE
CONTINENT HE ARRIVED AT THE SPOT ON THE RHINE WHICH IS NOW OCCUPIED BY
SACKINGEN AND PROPOSED TO SETTLE THERE BUT THE PEOPLE WARNED HIM OFF
HE APPEALED TO THE KING OF THE FRANKS WHO MADE HIM A PRESENT OF THE
WHOLE REGION PEOPLE AND ALL HE BUILT A GREAT CLOISTER THERE FOR WOMEN
AND PROCEEDED TO TEACH IN IT AND ACCUMULATE MORE LAND THERE WERE TWO
WEALTHY BROTHERS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD URSO AND LANDULPH URSO DIED AND
FRIDOLIN CLAIMED HIS ESTATES LANDULPH ASKED FOR DOCUMENTS AND PAPERS
FRIDOLIN HAD NONE TO SHOW HE SAID THE BEQUEST HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM BY
WORD OF MOUTH LANDULPH SUGGESTED THAT HE PRODUCE A WITNESS AND SAID IT
IN A WAY WHICH HE THOUGHT WAS VERY WITTY VERY SARCASTIC THIS SHOWS
THAT HE DID NOT KNOW THE WALKING DELEGATE FRIDOLIN WAS NOT DISTURBED
HE SAID

APPOINT YOUR COURT I WILL BRING A WITNESS

THE COURT THUS CREATED CONSISTED OF FIFTEEN COUNTS AND BARONS A DAY
WAS APPOINTED FOR THE TRIAL OF THE CASE ON THAT DAY THE JUDGES TOOK
THEIR SEATS IN STATE AND PROCLAMATION WAS MADE THAT THE COURT WAS
READY FOR BUSINESS FIVE MINUTES TEN MINUTES FIFTEEN MINUTES PASSED
AND YET NO FRIDOLIN APPEARED LANDULPH ROSE AND WAS IN THE ACT OF
CLAIMING JUDGMENT BY DEFAULT WHEN A STRANGE CLACKING SOUND WAS HEARD
COMING UP THE STAIRS IN ANOTHER MOMENT FRIDOLIN ENTERED AT THE DOOR
AND CAME WALKING IN A DEEP HUSH DOWN THE MIDDLE AISLE WITH A TALL
SKELETON STALKING IN HIS REAR

AMAZEMENT AND TERROR SAT UPON EVERY COUNTENANCE FOR EVERYBODY
SUSPECTED THAT THE SKELETON WAS URSOS IT STOPPED BEFORE THE CHIEF
JUDGE AND RAISED ITS BONY ARM ALOFT AND BEGAN TO SPEAK WHILE ALL THE
ASSEMBLY SHUDDERED FOR THEY COULD SEE THE WORDS LEAK OUT BETWEEN ITS
RIBS IT SAID

BROTHER WHY DOST THOU DISTURB MY BLESSED REST AND WITHHOLD BY ROBBERY
THE GIFT WHICH I GAVE THEE FOR THE HONOR OF GOD

IT SEEMS A STRANGE THING AND MOST IRREGULAR BUT THE VERDICT WAS
ACTUALLY GIVEN AGAINST LANDULPH ON THE TESTIMONY OF THIS WANDERING
RACKHEAP OF UNIDENTIFIED BONES IN OUR DAY A SKELETON WOULD NOT BE
ALLOWED TO TESTIFY AT ALL FOR A SKELETON HAS NO MORAL RESPONSIBILITY
AND ITS WORD COULD NOT BE BELIEVED ON OATH AND THIS WAS PROBABLY ONE
OF THEM MOST SKELETONS ARE NOT TO BE BELIEVED ON OATH AND THIS WAS
PROBABLY ONE OF THEM HOWEVER THE INCIDENT IS VALUABLE AS PRESERVING
TO US A CURIOUS SAMPLE OF THE QUAINT LAWS OF EVIDENCE OF THAT REMOTE
TIMEA TIME SO REMOTE SO FAR BACK TOWARD THE BEGINNING OF ORIGINAL
IDIOCY THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BENCH OF JUDGES AND A BASKET OF
VEGETABLES WAS AS YET SO SLIGHT THAT WE MAY SAY WITH ALL CONFIDENCE
THAT IT DIDNT REALLY EXIST

DURING SEVERAL AFTERNOONS I HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN AN INTERESTING MAYBE
USEFUL PIECE OF WORKTHAT IS TO SAY I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE THE
MIGHTY JUNGFRAU EARN HER LIVINGEARN IT IN A MOST HUMBLE SPHERE BUT ON
A PRODIGIOUS SCALE ON A PRODIGIOUS SCALE OF NECESSITY FOR SHE
COULDNT DO ANYTHING IN A SMALL WAY WITH HER SIZE AND STYLE I HAVE
BEEN TRYING TO MAKE HER DO SERVICE ON A STUPENDOUS DIAL AND CHECK OFF
THE HOURS AS THEY GLIDE ALONG HER PALLID FACE UP THERE AGAINST THE SKY
AND TELL THE TIME OF DAY TO THE POPULATIONS LYING WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF
HER AND TO THE PEOPLE IN THE MOON IF THEY HAVE A GOOD TELESCOPE THERE

UNTIL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THE JUNGFRAUS ASPECT IS THAT OF A SPOTLESS
DESERT OF SNOW SET UPON EDGE AGAINST THE SKY BUT BY MIDAFTERNOON SOME
ELEVATIONS WHICH RISE OUT OF THE WESTERN BORDER OF THE DESERT WHOSE
PRESENCE YOU PERHAPS HAD NOT DETECTED OR SUSPECTED UP TO THAT TIME
BEGAN TO CAST BLACK SHADOWS EASTWARD ACROSS THE GLEAMING SURFACE AT
FIRST THERE IS ONLY ONE SHADOW LATER THERE ARE TWO TOWARD PM THE
OTHER DAY I WAS GAZING AND WORSHIPING AS USUAL WHEN I CHANCED TO NOTICE
THAT SHADOW NO WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE ITSELF SOMETHING OF THE SHAPE
OF THE HUMAN PROFILE BY FOUR THE BACK OF THE HEAD WAS GOOD THE
MILITARY CAP WAS PRETTY GOOD THE NOSE WAS BOLD AND STRONG THE UPPER
LIP SHARP BUT NOT PRETTY AND THERE WAS A GREAT GOATEE THAT SHOT
STRAIGHT AGGRESSIVELY FORWARD FROM THE CHIN

AT FOURTHIRTY THE NOSE HAD CHANGED ITS SHAPE CONSIDERABLY AND THE
ALTERED SLANT OF THE SUN HAD REVEALED AND MADE CONSPICUOUS A HUGE
BUTTRESS OR BARRIER OF NAKED ROCK WHICH WAS SO LOCATED AS TO ANSWER
VERY WELL FOR A SHOULDER OR COATCOLLAR TO THIS SWARTHY AND INDISCREET
SWEETHEART WHO HAD STOLEN OUT THERE RIGHT BEFORE EVERYBODY TO PILLOW
HIS HEAD ON THE VIRGINS WHITE BREAST AND WHISPER SOFT SENTIMENTALITIES
TO HER IN THE SENSUOUS MUSIC OF THE CRASHING ICEDOMES AND THE BOOM AND
THUNDER OF THE PASSING AVALANCHEMUSIC VERY FAMILIAR TO HIS EAR FOR HE
HAS HEARD IT EVERY AFTERNOON AT THIS HOUR SINCE THE DAY HE FIRST CAME
COURTING THIS CHILD OF THE EARTH WHO LIVES IN THE SKY AND THAT DAY IS
FAR YESFOR HE WAS AT THIS PLEASANT SPORT BEFORE THE MIDDLE AGES
DRIFTED BY HIM IN THE VALLEY BEFORE THE ROMANS MARCHED PAST AND
BEFORE THE ANTIQUE AND RECORDLESS BARBARIANS FISHED AND HUNTED HERE AND
WONDERED WHO HE MIGHT BE AND WERE PROBABLY AFRAID OF HIM AND BEFORE
PRIMEVAL MAN HIMSELF JUST EMERGED FROM HIS FOURFOOTED ESTATE STEPPED
OUT UPON THIS PLAIN FIRST SAMPLE OF HIS RACE A THOUSAND CENTURIES
AGO AND CAST A GLAD EYE UP THERE JUDGING HE HAD FOUND A BROTHER HUMAN
BEING AND CONSEQUENTLY SOMETHING TO KILL AND BEFORE THE BIG SAURIANS
WALLOWED HERE STILL SOME EONS EARLIER OH YES A DAY SO FAR BACK THAT
THE ETERNAL SON WAS PRESENT TO SEE THAT FIRST VISIT A DAY SO FAR BACK
THAT NEITHER TRADITION NOR HISTORY WAS BORN YET AND A WHOLE WEARY
ETERNITY MUST COME AND GO BEFORE THE RESTLESS LITTLE CREATURE OF WHOSE
FACE THIS STUPENDOUS SHADOW FACE WAS THE PROPHECY WOULD ARRIVE IN THE
EARTH AND BEGIN HIS SHABBY CAREER AND THINK IT A BIG THING OH INDEED
YES WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR POOR ROMAN AND EGYPTIAN
DAYBEFOREYESTERDAY ANTIQUITIES YOU SHOULD CHOOSE A TIME WHEN THE
HOARY SHADOW FACE OF THE JUNGFRAU IS NOT BY IT ANTEDATES ALL
ANTIQUITIES KNOWN OR IMAGINABLE FOR IT WAS HERE THE WORLD ITSELF
CREATED THE THEATER OF FUTURE ANTIQUITIES AND IT IS THE ONLY WITNESS
WITH A HUMAN FACE THAT WAS THERE TO SEE THE MARVEL AND REMAINS TO US A
MEMORIAL OF IT

BY PM THE NOSE OF THE SHADOW IS PERFECT AND IS BEAUTIFUL IT IS
BLACK AND IS POWERFULLY MARKED AGAINST THE UPRIGHT CANVAS OF GLOWING
SNOW AND COVERS HUNDREDS OF ACRES OF THAT RESPLENDENT SURFACE

MEANTIME SHADOW NO HAS BEEN CREEPING OUT WELL TO THE REAR OF THE
FACE WEST OF ITAND AT FIVE OCLOCK HAS ASSUMED A SHAPE THAT HAS RATHER
A POOR AND RUDE SEMBLANCE OF A SHOE

MEANTIME ALSO THE GREAT SHADOW FACE HAS BEEN GRADUALLY CHANGING FOR
TWENTY MINUTES AND NOW PM IT IS BECOMING A QUITE FAIR PORTRAIT
OF ROSCOE CONKLING THE LIKENESS IS THERE AND IS UNMISTAKABLE THE
GOATEE IS SHORTENED NOW AND HAS AN END FORMERLY IT HADNT ANY BUT
RAN OFF EASTWARD AND ARRIVED NOWHERE

BY PM THE FACE HAS DISSOLVED AND GONE AND THE GOATEE HAS BECOME
WHAT LOOKS LIKE THE SHADOW OF A TOWER WITH A POINTED ROOF AND THE SHOE
HAD TURNED INTO WHAT THE PRINTERS CALL A FIST WITH A FINGER POINTING

IF I WERE NOW IMPRISONED ON A MOUNTAIN SUMMIT A HUNDRED MILES NORTHWARD
OF THIS POINT AND WAS DENIED A TIMEPIECE I COULD GET ALONG WELL
ENOUGH FROM FOUR TILL SIX ON CLEAR DAYS FOR I COULD KEEP TRACE OF THE
TIME BY THE CHANGING SHAPES OF THESE MIGHTY SHADOWS ON THE VIRGINS
FRONT THE MOST STUPENDOUS DIAL I AM ACQUAINTED WITH THE OLDEST CLOCK
IN THE WORLD BY A COUPLE OF MILLION YEARS

I SUPPOSE I SHOULD NOT HAVE NOTICED THE FORMS OF THE SHADOWS IF I
HADNT THE HABIT OF HUNTING FOR FACES IN THE CLOUDS AND IN MOUNTAIN
CRAGSA SORT OF AMUSEMENT WHICH IS VERY ENTERTAINING EVEN WHEN YOU
DONT FIND ANY AND BRILLIANTLY SATISFYING WHEN YOU DO I HAVE SEARCHED
THROUGH SEVERAL BUSHELS OF PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE JUNGFRAU HERE BUT FOUND
ONLY ONE WITH THE FACE IN IT AND IN THIS CASE IT WAS NOT STRICTLY
RECOGNIZABLE AS A FACE WHICH WAS EVIDENCE THAT THE PICTURE WAS TAKEN
BEFORE FOUR OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON AND ALSO EVIDENCE THAT ALL THE
PHOTOGRAPHERS HAVE PERSISTENTLY OVERLOOKED ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING
FEATURES OF THE JUNGFRAU SHOW I SAY FASCINATING BECAUSE IF YOU ONCE
DETECT A HUMAN FACE PRODUCED ON A GREAT PLAN BY UNCONSCIOUS NATURE YOU
NEVER GET TIRED OF WATCHING IT AT FIRST YOU CANT MAKE ANOTHER PERSON
SEE IT AT ALL BUT AFTER HE HAS MADE IT OUT ONCE HE CANT SEE ANYTHING
ELSE AFTERWARD

THE KING OF GREECE IS A MAN WHO GOES AROUND QUIETLY ENOUGH WHEN OFF
DUTY ONE DAY THIS SUMMER HE WAS TRAVELING IN AN ORDINARY FIRSTCLASS
COMPARTMENT JUST IN HIS OTHER SUIT THE ONE WHICH HE WORKS THE REALM
IN WHEN HE IS AT HOME AND SO HE WAS NOT LOOKING LIKE ANYBODY IN
PARTICULAR BUT A GOOD DEAL LIKE EVERYBODY IN GENERAL BY AND BY A
HEARTY AND HEALTHY GERMANAMERICAN GOT IN AND OPENED UP A FRANK AND
INTERESTING AND SYMPATHETIC CONVERSATION WITH HIM AND ASKED HIM A
COUPLE OF THOUSAND QUESTIONS ABOUT HIMSELF WHICH THE KING ANSWERED

AT THE SHRINE OF ST WAGNER


BAYREUTH AUG D

IT WAS AT NUREMBERG THAT WE STRUCK THE INUNDATION OF MUSICMAD
STRANGERS THAT WAS ROLLING DOWN UPON BAYREUTH IT HAD BEEN LONG SINCE
WE HAD SEEN SUCH MULTITUDES OF EXCITED AND STRUGGLING PEOPLE IT TOOK A
GOOD HALFHOUR TO PACK THEM AND PAIR THEM INTO THE TRAINAND IT WAS THE
LONGEST TRAIN WE HAVE YET SEEN IN EUROPE NUREMBERG HAD BEEN WITNESSING
THIS SORT OF EXPERIENCE A COUPLE OF TIMES A DAY FOR ABOUT TWO WEEKS IT
GIVES ONE AN IMPRESSIVE SENSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS BIENNIAL
PILGRIMAGE FOR A PILGRIMAGE IS WHAT IT IS THE DEVOTEES COME FROM THE
VERY ENDS OF THE EARTH TO WORSHIP THEIR PROPHET IN HIS OWN KAABA IN HIS
OWN MECCA

IF YOU ARE LIVING IN NEW YORK OR SAN FRANCISCO OR CHICAGO OR ANYWHERE
ELSE IN AMERICA AND YOU CONCLUDE BY THE MIDDLE OF MAY THAT YOU WOULD
LIKE TO ATTEND THE BAYREUTH OPERA TWO MONTHS AND A HALF LATER YOU MUST
USE THE CABLE AND GET ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY OR YOU WILL GET NO SEATS
AND YOU MUST CABLE FOR LODGINGS TOO THEN IF YOU ARE LUCKY YOU WILL
GET SEATS IN THE LAST ROW AND LODGINGS IN THE FRINGE OF THE TOWN IF
YOU STOP TO WRITE YOU WILL GET NOTHING THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE IN
NUREMBERG WHEN WE PASSED THROUGH WHO HAD COME ON PILGRIMAGE WITHOUT
FIRST SECURING SEATS AND LODGINGS THEY HAD FOUND NEITHER IN BAYREUTH
THEY HAD WALKED BAYREUTH STREETS A WHILE IN SORROW THEN HAD GONE TO
NUREMBERG AND FOUND NEITHER BEDS NOR STANDING ROOM AND HAD WALKED
THOSE QUAINT STREETS ALL NIGHT WAITING FOR THE HOTELS TO OPEN AND
EMPTY THEIR GUESTS INTO THE TRAINS AND SO MAKE ROOM FOR THESE THEIR
DEFEATED BRETHREN AND SISTERS IN THE FAITH THEY HAD ENDURED FROM
THIRTY TO FORTY HOURS RAILROADING ON THE CONTINENT OF EUROPEWITH ALL
WHICH THAT IMPLIES OF WORRY FATIGUE AND FINANCIAL IMPOVERISHMENTAND
ALL THEY HAD GOT AND ALL THEY WERE TO GET FOR IT WAS HANDINESS AND
ACCURACY IN KICKING THEMSELVES ACQUIRED BY PRACTICE IN THE BACK
STREETS OF THE TWO TOWNS WHEN OTHER PEOPLE WERE IN BED FOR BACK THEY
MUST GO OVER THAT UNSPEAKABLE JOURNEY WITH THEIR PIOUS MISSION
UNFULFILLED THESE HUMILIATED OUTCASTS HAD THE FROWSY AND UNBRUSHED AND
APOLOGETIC LOOK OF WET CATS AND THEIR EYES WERE GLAZED WITH
DROWSINESS THEIR BODIES WERE ADROOP FROM CROWN TO SOLE AND ALL
KINDHEARTED PEOPLE REFRAINED FROM ASKING THEM IF THEY HAD BEEN TO
BAYREUTH AND FAILED TO CONNECT AS KNOWING THEY WOULD LIE

WE REACHED HERE BAYREUTH ABOUT MIDAFTERNOON OF A RAINY SATURDAY WE
WERE OF THE WISE AND HAD SECURED LODGINGS AND OPERA SEATS MONTHS IN
ADVANCE

I AM NOT A MUSICAL CRITIC AND DID NOT COME HERE TO WRITE ESSAYS ABOUT
THE OPERAS AND DELIVER JUDGMENT UPON THEIR MERITS THE LITTLE CHILDREN
OF BAYREUTH COULD DO THAT WITH A FINER SYMPATHY AND A BROADER
INTELLIGENCE THAN I I ONLY CARE TO BRING FOUR OR FIVE PILGRIMS TO THE
OPERAS PILGRIMS ABLE TO APPRECIATE THEM AND ENJOY THEM WHAT I WRITE
ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE TO PUT IN MY ODD TIME WOULD BE OFFERED TO THE
PUBLIC AS MERELY A CATS VIEW OF A KING AND NOT OF DIDACTIC VALUE

NEXT DAY WHICH WAS SUNDAY WE LEFT FOR THE OPERAHOUSETHAT IS TO SAY
THE WAGNER TEMPLEA LITTLE AFTER THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON THE GREAT
BUILDING STANDS ALL BY ITSELF GRAND AND LONELY ON A HIGH GROUND
OUTSIDE THE TOWN WE WERE WARNED THAT IF WE ARRIVED AFTER FOUR OCLOCK
WE SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO PAY TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF APIECE EXTRA BY WAY
OF FINE WE SAVED THAT AND IT MAY BE REMARKED HERE THAT THIS IS THE
ONLY OPPORTUNITY THAT EUROPE OFFERS OF SAVING MONEY THERE WAS A BIG
CROWD IN THE GROUNDS ABOUT THE BUILDING AND THE LADIES DRESSES TOOK
THE SUN WITH FINE EFFECT I DO NOT MEAN TO INTIMATE THAT THE LADIES
WERE IN FULL DRESS FOR THAT WAS NOT SO THE DRESSES WERE PRETTY BUT
NEITHER SEX WAS IN EVENING DRESS

THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING IS SIMPLESEVERELY SO BUT THERE IS NO
OCCASION FOR COLOR AND DECORATION SINCE THE PEOPLE SIT IN THE DARK
THE AUDITORIUM HAS THE SHAPE OF A KEYSTONE WITH THE STAGE AT THE
NARROW END THERE IS AN AISLE ON EACH SIDE BUT NO AISLE IN THE BODY OF
THE HOUSE EACH ROW OF SEATS EXTENDS IN AN UNBROKEN CURVE FROM ONE SIDE
OF THE HOUSE TO THE OTHER THERE ARE SEVEN ENTRANCE DOORS ON EACH SIDE
OF THE THEATER AND FOUR AT THE BUTT EIGHTEEN DOORS TO ADMIT AND EMIT
PERSONS THE NUMBER OF THE PARTICULAR DOOR BY WHICH YOU ARE TO
ENTER THE HOUSE OR LEAVE IT IS PRINTED ON YOUR TICKET AND YOU CAN USE
NO DOOR BUT THAT ONE THUS CROWDING AND CONFUSION ARE IMPOSSIBLE NOT
SO MANY AS A HUNDRED PEOPLE USE ANY ONE DOOR THIS IS BETTER THAN
HAVING THE USUAL AND USELESS ELABORATE FIREPROOF ARRANGEMENTS IT IS
THE MODEL THEATER OF THE WORLD IT CAN BE EMPTIED WHILE THE SECOND HAND
OF A WATCH MAKES ITS CIRCUIT IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY SAFE EVEN IF IT
WERE BUILT OF LUCIFER MATCHES

IF YOUR SEAT IS NEAR THE CENTER OF A ROW AND YOU ENTER LATE YOU MUST
WORK YOUR WAY ALONG A RANK OF ABOUT TWENTYFIVE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN TO
GET TO IT YET THIS CAUSES NO TROUBLE FOR EVERYBODY STANDS UP UNTIL
ALL THE SEATS ARE FULL AND THE FILLING IS ACCOMPLISHED IN A VERY FEW
MINUTES THEN ALL SIT DOWN AND YOU HAVE A SOLID MASS OF FIFTEEN
HUNDRED HEADS MAKING A STEEP CELLARDOOR SLANT FROM THE REAR OF THE
HOUSE DOWN TO THE STAGE

ALL THE LIGHTS WERE TURNED LOW SO LOW THAT THE CONGREGATION SAT IN A
DEEP AND SOLEMN GLOOM THE FUNEREAL RUSTLING OF DRESSES AND THE LOW
BUZZ OF CONVERSATION BEGAN TO DIE SWIFTLY DOWN AND PRESENTLY NOT THE
GHOST OF A SOUND WAS LEFT THIS PROFOUND AND INCREASINGLY IMPRESSIVE
STILLNESS ENDURED FOR SOME TIMETHE BEST PREPARATION FOR MUSIC
SPECTACLE OR SPEECH CONCEIVABLE I SHOULD THINK OUR SHOW PEOPLE WOULD
HAVE INVENTED OR IMPORTED THAT SIMPLE AND IMPRESSIVE DEVICE FOR
SECURING AND SOLIDIFYING THE ATTENTION OF AN AUDIENCE LONG AGO INSTEAD
OF WHICH THEY CONTINUE TO THIS DAY TO OPEN A PERFORMANCE AGAINST A
DEADLY COMPETITION IN THE FORM OF NOISE CONFUSION AND A SCATTERED
INTEREST

FINALLY OUT OF DARKNESS AND DISTANCE AND MYSTERY SOFT RICH NOTES ROSE
UPON THE STILLNESS AND FROM HIS GRAVE THE DEAD MAGICIAN BEGAN TO WEAVE
HIS SPELLS ABOUT HIS DISCIPLES AND STEEP THEIR SOULS IN HIS
ENCHANTMENTS THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGELY IMPRESSIVE IN THE FANCY
WHICH KEPT INTRUDING ITSELF THAT THE COMPOSER WAS CONSCIOUS IN HIS
GRAVE OF WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE AND THAT THESE DIVINE SOUNDS WERE THE
CLOTHING OF THOUGHTS WHICH WERE AT THIS MOMENT PASSING THROUGH HIS
BRAIN AND NOT RECOGNIZED AND FAMILIAR ONES WHICH HAD ISSUED FROM IT AT
SOME FORMER TIME

THE ENTIRE OVERTURE LONG AS IT WAS WAS PLAYED TO A DARK HOUSE WITH
THE CURTAIN DOWN IT WAS EXQUISITE IT WAS DELICIOUS BUT STRAIGHTWAY
THEREAFTER OF COURSE CAME THE SINGING AND IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT
NOTHING CAN MAKE A WAGNER OPERA ABSOLUTELY PERFECT AND SATISFACTORY TO
THE UNTUTORED BUT TO LEAVE OUT THE VOCAL PARTS I WISH I COULD SEE A
WAGNER OPERA DONE IN PANTOMIME ONCE THEN ONE WOULD HAVE THE LOVELY
ORCHESTRATION UNVEXED TO LISTEN TO AND BATHE HIS SPIRIT IN AND THE
BEWILDERING BEAUTIFUL SCENERY TO INTOXICATE HIS EYES WITH AND THE DUMB
ACTING COULDNT MAR THESE PLEASURES BECAUSE THERE ISNT OFTEN ANYTHING
IN THE WAGNER OPERA THAT ONE WOULD CALL BY SUCH A VIOLENT NAME AS
ACTING AS A RULE ALL YOU WOULD SEE WOULD BE A COUPLE OF SILENT PEOPLE
ONE OF THEM STANDING STILL THE OTHER CATCHING FLIES OF COURSE I DO
NOT REALLY MEAN THAT HE WOULD BE CATCHING FLIES I ONLY MEAN THAT THE
USUAL OPERATIC GESTURES WHICH CONSIST IN REACHING FIRST ONE HAND OUT
INTO THE AIR AND THEN THE OTHER MIGHT SUGGEST THE SPORT I SPEAK OF IF
THE OPERATOR ATTENDED STRICTLY TO BUSINESS AND UTTERED NO SOUND

THIS PRESENT OPERA WAS PARSIFAL MADAME WAGNER DOES NOT PERMIT ITS
REPRESENTATION ANYWHERE BUT IN BAYREUTH THE FIRST ACT OF THE THREE
OCCUPIED TWO HOURS AND I ENJOYED THAT IN SPITE OF THE SINGING

I TRUST THAT I KNOW AS WELL AS ANYBODY THAT SINGING IS ONE OF THE MOST
ENTRANCING AND BEWITCHING AND MOVING AND ELOQUENT OF ALL THE VEHICLES
INVENTED BY MAN FOR THE CONVEYING OF FEELING BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
THE CHIEF VIRTUE IN SONG IS MELODY AIR TUNE RHYTHM OR WHAT YOU
PLEASE TO CALL IT AND THAT WHEN THIS FEATURE IS ABSENT WHAT REMAINS IS
A PICTURE WITH THE COLOR LEFT OUT I WAS NOT ABLE TO DETECT IN THE
VOCAL PARTS OF PARSIFAL ANYTHING THAT MIGHT WITH CONFIDENCE BE CALLED
RHYTHM OR TUNE OR MELODY ONE PERSON PERFORMED AT A TIMEAND A LONG
TIME TOOOFTEN IN A NOBLE AND ALWAYS IN A HIGHTONED VOICE BUT HE
ONLY PULLED OUT LONG NOTES THEN SOME SHORT ONES THEN ANOTHER LONG
ONE THEN A SHARP QUICK PEREMPTORY BARK OR TWOAND SO ON AND SO ON
AND WHEN HE WAS DONE YOU SAW THAT THE INFORMATION WHICH HE HAD CONVEYED
HAD NOT COMPENSATED FOR THE DISTURBANCE NOT ALWAYS BUT PRETTY OFTEN
IF TWO OF THEM WOULD BUT PUT IN A DUET OCCASIONALLY AND BLEND THE
VOICES BUT NO THEY DONT DO THAT THE GREAT MASTER WHO KNEW SO WELL
HOW TO MAKE A HUNDRED INSTRUMENTS REJOICE IN UNISON AND POUR OUT THEIR
SOULS IN MINGLED AND MELODIOUS TIDES OF DELICIOUS SOUND DEALS ONLY IN
BARREN SOLOS WHEN HE PUTS IN THE VOCAL PARTS IT MAY BE THAT HE WAS
DEEP AND ONLY ADDED THE SINGING TO HIS OPERAS FOR THE SAKE OF THE
CONTRAST IT WOULD MAKE WITH THE MUSIC SINGING IT DOES SEEM THE WRONG
NAME TO APPLY TO IT STRICTLY DESCRIBED IT IS A PRACTICING OF
DIFFICULT AND UNPLEASANT INTERVALS MAINLY AN IGNORANT PERSON GETS
TIRED OF LISTENING TO GYMNASTIC INTERVALS IN THE LONG RUN NO MATTER
HOW PLEASANT THEY MAY BE IN PARSIFAL THERE IS A HERMIT NAMED
GURNEMANZ WHO STANDS ON THE STAGE IN ONE SPOT AND PRACTICES BY THE
HOUR WHILE FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER CHARACTER OF THE CAST ENDURES
WHAT HE CAN OF IT AND THEN RETIRES TO DIE

DURING THE EVENING THERE WAS AN INTERMISSION OF THREEQUARTERS OF AN
HOUR AFTER THE FIRST ACT AND ONE AN HOUR LONG AFTER THE SECOND IN BOTH
INSTANCES THE THEATER WAS TOTALLY EMPTIED PEOPLE WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY
ENGAGED TABLES IN THE ONE SOLE EATINGHOUSE WERE ABLE TO PUT IN THEIR
TIME VERY SATISFACTORILY THE OTHER THOUSAND WENT HUNGRY THE OPERA WAS
CONCLUDED AT TEN IN THE EVENING OR A LITTLE LATER WHEN WE REACHED HOME
WE HAD BEEN GONE MORE THAN SEVEN HOURS SEVEN HOURS AT FIVE DOLLARS A
TICKET IS ALMOST TOO MUCH FOR THE MONEY

WHILE BROWSING ABOUT THE FRONT YARD AMONG THE CROWD BETWEEN THE ACTS I
ENCOUNTERED TWELVE OR FIFTEEN FRIENDS FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF AMERICA
AND THOSE OF THEM WHO WERE MOST FAMILIAR WITH WAGNER SAID THAT
PARSIFAL SELDOM PLEASED AT FIRST BUT THAT AFTER ONE HAD HEARD IT
SEVERAL TIMES IT WAS ALMOST SURE TO BECOME A FAVORITE IT SEEMED
IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT WAS TRUE FOR THE STATEMENT CAME FROM PEOPLE WHOSE
WORD WAS NOT TO BE DOUBTED

AND I GATHERED SOME FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE GROUND I FOUND PART OF
A GERMAN MUSICAL MAGAZINE AND IN IT A LETTER WRITTEN BY UHLIC
THIRTYTHREE YEARS AGO IN WHICH HE DEFENDS THE SCORNED AND ABUSED
WAGNER AGAINST PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO FOUND FAULT WITH THE COMPREHENSIVE
ABSENCE OF WHAT OUR KIND REGARDS AS SINGING UHLIC SAYS WAGNER DESPISED
JENE PLAPPERUDE MUSIC AND THEREFORE RUNS TRILLS AND SCHNORKEL
ARE DISCARDED BY HIM I DONT KNOW WHAT A SCHNORKEL IS BUT NOW
THAT I KNOW IT HAS BEEN LEFT OUT OF THESE OPERAS I NEVER HAVE MISSED SO
MUCH IN MY LIFE AND UHLIC FURTHER SAYS THAT WAGNERS SONG IS TRUE
THAT IT IS SIMPLY EMPHASIZED INTONED SPEECH THAT CERTAINLY DESCRIBES
ITIN PARSIFAL AND SOME OF THE OTHER OPERAS AND IF I UNDERSTAND
UHLICS ELABORATE GERMAN HE APOLOGIZES FOR THE BEAUTIFUL AIRS IN
TANNHAUSER VERY WELL NOW THAT WAGNER AND I UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER
PERHAPS WE SHALL GET ALONG BETTER AND I SHALL STOP CALLING WAGGNER ON
THE AMERICAN PLAN AND THEREAFTER CALL HIM WAGGNER AS PER GERMAN
CUSTOM FOR I FEEL ENTIRELY FRIENDLY NOW THE MINUTE WE GET RECONCILED
TO A PERSON HOW WILLING WE ARE TO THROW ASIDE LITTLE NEEDLESS
PUNCTILIOS AND PRONOUNCE HIS NAME RIGHT

OF COURSE I CAME HOME WONDERING WHY PEOPLE SHOULD COME FROM ALL CORNERS
OF AMERICA TO HEAR THESE OPERAS WHEN WE HAVE LATELY HAD A SEASON OR
TWO OF THEM IN NEW YORK WITH THESE SAME SINGERS IN THE SEVERAL PARTS
AND POSSIBLY THIS SAME ORCHESTRA I RESOLVED TO THINK THAT OUT AT ALL
HAZARDS

TUESDAYYESTERDAY THEY PLAYED THE ONLY OPERATIC FAVORITE I HAVE EVER
HADAN OPERA WHICH HAS ALWAYS DRIVEN ME MAD WITH IGNORANT DELIGHT
WHENEVER I HAVE HEARD ITTANNHAUSER I HEARD IT FIRST WHEN I WAS A
YOUTH I HEARD IT LAST IN THE LAST GERMAN SEASON IN NEW YORK I WAS
BUSY YESTERDAY AND I DID NOT INTEND TO GO KNOWING I SHOULD HAVE
ANOTHER TANNHAUSER OPPORTUNITY IN A FEW DAYS BUT AFTER FIVE OCLOCK
I FOUND MYSELF FREE AND WALKED OUT TO THE OPERAHOUSE AND ARRIVED ABOUT
THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND ACT MY OPERA TICKET ADMITTED ME TO THE
GROUNDS IN FRONT PAST THE POLICEMAN AND THE CHAIN AND I THOUGHT I
WOULD TAKE A REST ON A BENCH FOR AN HOUR AND TWO AND WAIT FOR THE THIRD
ACT

IN A MOMENT OR SO THE FIRST BUGLES BLEW AND THE MULTITUDE BEGAN TO
CRUMBLE APART AND MELT INTO THE THEATER I WILL EXPLAIN THAT THIS
BUGLECALL IS ONE OF THE PRETTY FEATURES HERE YOU SEE THE THEATER IS
EMPTY AND HUNDREDS OF THE AUDIENCE ARE A GOOD WAY OFF IN THE
FEEDINGHOUSE THE FIRST BUGLECALL IS BLOWN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
BEFORE TIME FOR THE CURTAIN TO RISE THIS COMPANY OF BUGLERS IN
UNIFORM MARCH OUT WITH MILITARY STEP AND SEND OUT OVER THE LANDSCAPE A
FEW BARS OF THE THEME OF THE APPROACHING ACT PIERCING THE DISTANCES
WITH THE GRACIOUS NOTES THEN THEY MARCH TO THE OTHER ENTRANCE AND
REPEAT PRESENTLY THEY DO THIS OVER AGAIN YESTERDAY ONLY ABOUT TWO
HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE STILL LEFT IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE WHEN THE SECOND
CALL WAS BLOWN IN ANOTHER HALFMINUTE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE
HOUSE BUT THEN A THING HAPPENED WHICH DELAYED THEMTHE ONLY SOLITARY
THING IN THIS WORLD WHICH COULD BE RELIED ON WITH CERTAINTY TO
ACCOMPLISH THIS I SUPPOSEAN IMPERIAL PRINCESS APPEARED IN THE BALCONY
ABOVE THEM THEY STOPPED DEAD IN THEIR TRACKS AND BEGAN TO GAZE IN A
STUPOR OF GRATITUDE AND SATISFACTION THE LADY PRESENTLY SAW THAT SHE
MUST DISAPPEAR OR THE DOORS WOULD BE CLOSED UPON THESE WORSHIPERS SO
SHE RETURNED TO HER BOX THIS DAUGHTERINLAW OF AN EMPEROR WAS PRETTY
SHE HAD A KIND FACE SHE WAS WITHOUT AIRS SHE IS KNOWN TO BE FULL OF
COMMON HUMAN SYMPATHIES THERE ARE MANY KINDS OF PRINCESSES BUT THIS
KIND IS THE MOST HARMFUL OF ALL FOR WHEREVER THEY GO THEY RECONCILE
PEOPLE TO MONARCHY AND SET BACK THE CLOCK OF PROGRESS THE VALUABLE
PRINCES THE DESIRABLE PRINCES ARE THE CZARS AND THEIR SORT BY THEIR
MERE DUMB PRESENCE IN THE WORLD THEY COVER WITH DERISION EVERY ARGUMENT
THAT CAN BE INVENTED IN FAVOR OF ROYALTY BY THE MOST INGENIOUS CASUIST
IN HIS TIME THE HUSBAND OF THIS PRINCESS WAS VALUABLE HE LED A
DEGRADED LIFE HE ENDED IT WITH HIS OWN HAND IN CIRCUMSTANCES AND
SURROUNDINGS OF A HIDEOUS SORT AND WAS BURIED LIKE A GOD

IN THE OPERAHOUSE THERE IS A LONG LOFT BACK OF THE AUDIENCE A KIND OF
OPEN GALLERY IN WHICH PRINCES ARE DISPLAYED IT IS SACRED TO THEM IT
IS THE HOLY OF HOLIES AS SOON AS THE FILLING OF THE HOUSE IS ABOUT
COMPLETE THE STANDING MULTITUDE TURN AND FIX THEIR EYES UPON THE
PRINCELY LAYOUT AND GAZE MUTELY AND LONGINGLY AND ADORINGLY AND
REGRETFULLY LIKE SINNERS LOOKING INTO HEAVEN THEY BECOME RAPT
UNCONSCIOUS STEEPED IN WORSHIP THERE IS NO SPECTACLE ANYWHERE THAT IS
MORE PATHETIC THAN THIS IT IS WORTH CROSSING MANY OCEANS TO SEE IT IS
SOMEHOW NOT THE SAME GAZE THAT PEOPLE RIVET UPON A VICTOR HUGO OR
NIAGARA OR THE BONES OF THE MASTODON OR THE GUILLOTINE OF THE
REVOLUTION OR THE GREAT PYRAMID OR DISTANT VESUVIUS SMOKING IN THE
SKY OR ANY MAN LONG CELEBRATED TO YOU BY HIS GENIUS AND ACHIEVEMENTS
OR THING LONG CELEBRATED TO YOU BY THE PRAISES OF BOOKS AND
PICTURESNO THAT GAZE IS ONLY THE GAZE OF INTENSE CURIOSITY INTEREST
WONDER ENGAGED IN DRINKING DELICIOUS DEEP DRAUGHTS THAT TASTE GOOD ALL
THE WAY DOWN AND APPEASE AND SATISFY THE THIRST OF A LIFETIME SATISFY
ITTHAT IS THE WORD HUGO AND THE MASTODON WILL STILL HAVE A DEGREE OF
INTENSE INTEREST THEREAFTER WHEN ENCOUNTERED BUT NEVER ANYTHING
APPROACHING THE ECSTASY OF THAT FIRST VIEW THE INTEREST OF A PRINCE IS
DIFFERENT IT MAY BE ENVY IT MAY BE WORSHIP DOUBTLESS IT IS A MIXTURE
OF BOTHAND IT DOES NOT SATISFY ITS THIRST WITH ONE VIEW OR EVEN
NOTICEABLY DIMINISH IT PERHAPS THE ESSENCE OF THE THING IS THE VALUE
WHICH MEN ATTACH TO A VALUABLE SOMETHING WHICH HAS COME BY LUCK AND NOT
BEEN EARNED A DOLLAR PICKED UP IN THE ROAD IS MORE SATISFACTION TO YOU
THAN THE NINETYANDNINE WHICH YOU HAD TO WORK FOR AND MONEY WON AT
FARO OR IN STOCKS SNUGGLES INTO YOUR HEART IN THE SAME WAY A PRINCE
PICKS UP GRANDEUR POWER AND A PERMANENT HOLIDAY AND GRATIS SUPPORT BY
A PURE ACCIDENT THE ACCIDENT OF BIRTH AND HE STANDS ALWAYS BEFORE THE
GRIEVED EYE OF POVERTY AND OBSCURITY A MONUMENTAL REPRESENTATIVE OF
LUCK AND THENSUPREMEST VALUE OF ALLHIS IS THE ONLY HIGH FORTUNE ON
THE EARTH WHICH IS SECURE THE COMMERCIAL MILLIONAIRE MAY BECOME A
BEGGAR THE ILLUSTRIOUS STATESMAN CAN MAKE A VITAL MISTAKE AND BE
DROPPED AND FORGOTTEN THE ILLUSTRIOUS GENERAL CAN LOSE A DECISIVE
BATTLE AND WITH IT THE CONSIDERATION OF MEN BUT ONCE A PRINCE ALWAYS A
PRINCETHAT IS TO SAY AN IMITATION GOD AND NEITHER HARD FORTUNE NOR
AN INFAMOUS CHARACTER NOR AN ADDLED BRAIN NOR THE SPEECH OF AN ASS CAN
UNDEIFY HIM BY COMMON CONSENT OF ALL THE NATIONS AND ALL THE AGES THE
MOST VALUABLE THING IN THIS WORLD IS THE HOMAGE OF MEN WHETHER
DESERVED OR UNDESERVED IT FOLLOWS WITHOUT DOUBT OR QUESTION THEN
THAT THE MOST DESIRABLE POSITION POSSIBLE IS THAT OF A PRINCE AND I
THINK IT ALSO FOLLOWS THAT THE SOCALLED USURPATIONS WITH WHICH HISTORY
IS LITTERED ARE THE MOST EXCUSABLE MISDEMEANORS WHICH MEN HAVE
COMMITTED TO USURP A USURPATIONTHAT IS ALL IT AMOUNTS TO ISNT IT

A PRINCE IS NOT TO US WHAT HE IS TO A EUROPEAN OF COURSE WE HAVE NOT
BEEN TAUGHT TO REGARD HIM AS A GOD AND SO ONE GOOD LOOK AT HIM IS
LIKELY TO SO NEARLY APPEASE OUR CURIOSITY AS TO MAKE HIM AN OBJECT OF
NO GREATER INTEREST THE NEXT TIME WE WANT A FRESH ONE BUT IT IS NOT
SO WITH THE EUROPEAN I AM QUITE SURE OF IT THE SAME OLD ONE WILL
ANSWER HE NEVER STALES EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO I WAS IN LONDON AND I
CALLED AT AN ENGLISHMANS HOUSE ON A BLEAK AND FOGGY AND DISMAL
DECEMBER AFTERNOON TO VISIT HIS WIFE AND MARRIED DAUGHTER BY
APPOINTMENT I WAITED HALF AN HOUR AND THEN THEY ARRIVED FROZEN THEY
EXPLAINED THAT THEY HAD BEEN DELAYED BY AN UNLOOKEDFOR CIRCUMSTANCE
WHILE PASSING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF MARLBOROUGH HOUSE THEY SAW A CROWD
GATHERING AND WERE TOLD THAT THE PRINCE OF WALES WAS ABOUT TO DRIVE
OUT SO THEY STOPPED TO GET A SIGHT OF HIM THEY HAD WAITED HALF AN
HOUR ON THE SIDEWALK FREEZING WITH THE CROWD BUT WERE DISAPPOINTED AT
LASTTHE PRINCE HAD CHANGED HIS MIND I SAID WITH A GOOD DEAL OF
SURPRISE IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU TWO HAVE LIVED IN LONDON ALL YOUR
LIVES AND HAVE NEVER SEEN THE PRINCE OF WALES

APPARENTLY IT WAS THEIR TURN TO BE SURPRISED FOR THEY EXCLAIMED WHAT
AN IDEA WHY WE HAVE SEEN HIM HUNDREDS OF TIMES

THEY HAD SEEN HIM HUNDREDS OF TIMES YET THEY HAD WAITED HALF AN HOUR
IN THE GLOOM AND THE BITTER COLD IN THE MIDST OF A JAM OF PATIENTS
FROM THE SAME ASYLUM ON THE CHANCE OF SEEING HIM AGAIN IT WAS A
STUPEFYING STATEMENT BUT ONE IS OBLIGED TO BELIEVE THE ENGLISH EVEN
WHEN THEY SAY A THING LIKE THAT I FUMBLED AROUND FOR A REMARK AND GOT
OUT THIS ONE

I CANT UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL IF I HAD NEVER SEEN GENERAL GRANT I
DOUBT IF I WOULD DO THAT EVEN TO GET A SIGHT OF HIM WITH A SLIGHT
EMPHASIS ON THE LAST WORD

THEIR BLANK FACES SHOWED THAT THEY WONDERED WHERE THE PARALLEL CAME IN
THEN THEY SAID BLANKLY OF COURSE NOT HE IS ONLY A PRESIDENT

IT IS DOUBTLESS A FACT THAT A PRINCE IS A PERMANENT INTEREST AN
INTEREST NOT SUBJECT TO DETERIORATION THE GENERAL WHO WAS NEVER
DEFEATED THE GENERAL WHO NEVER HELD A COUNCIL OF WAR THE ONLY GENERAL
WHO EVER COMMANDED A CONNECTED BATTLEFRONT TWELVE HUNDRED MILES LONG
THE SMITH WHO WELDED TOGETHER THE BROKEN PARTS OF A GREAT REPUBLIC AND
REESTABLISHED IT WHERE IT IS QUITE LIKELY TO OUTLAST ALL THE
MONARCHIES PRESENT AND TO COME WAS REALLY A PERSON OF NO SERIOUS
CONSEQUENCE TO THESE PEOPLE TO THEM WITH THEIR TRAINING MY GENERAL
WAS ONLY A MAN AFTER ALL WHILE THEIR PRINCE WAS CLEARLY MUCH MORE
THAN THATA BEING OF A WHOLLY UNSIMILAR CONSTRUCTION AND CONSTITUTION
AND BEING OF NO MORE BLOOD AND KINSHIP WITH MEN THAN ARE THE SERENE
ETERNAL LIGHTS OF THE FIRMAMENT WITH THE POOR DULL TALLOW CANDLES OF
COMMERCE THAT SPUTTER AND DIE AND LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND BUT A PINCH OF
ASHES AND A STINK

I SAW THE LAST ACT OF TANNHAUSER I SAT IN THE GLOOM AND THE DEEP
STILLNESS WAITINGONE MINUTE TWO MINUTES I DO NOT KNOW EXACTLY HOW
LONGTHEN THE SOFT MUSIC OF THE HIDDEN ORCHESTRA BEGAN TO BREATHE ITS
RICH LONG SIGHS OUT FROM UNDER THE DISTANT STAGE AND BY AND BY THE
DROPCURTAIN PARTED IN THE MIDDLE AND WAS DRAWN SOFTLY ASIDE
DISCLOSING THE TWILIGHTED WOOD AND A WAYSIDE SHRINE WITH A WHITEROBED
GIRL PRAYING AND A MAN STANDING NEAR PRESENTLY THAT NOBLE CHORUS OF
MENS VOICES WAS HEARD APPROACHING AND FROM THAT MOMENT UNTIL THE
CLOSING OF THE CURTAIN IT WAS MUSIC JUST MUSICMUSIC TO MAKE ONE DRUNK
WITH PLEASURE MUSIC TO MAKE ONE TAKE SCRIP AND STAFF AND BEG HIS WAY
ROUND THE GLOBE TO HEAR IT

TO SUCH AS ARE INTENDING TO COME HERE IN THE WAGNER SEASON NEXT YEAR I
WISH TO SAY BRING YOUR DINNERPAIL WITH YOU IF YOU DO YOU WILL NEVER
CEASE TO BE THANKFUL IF YOU DO NOT YOU WILL FIND IT A HARD FIGHT TO
SAVE YOURSELF FROM FAMISHING IN BAYREUTH BAYREUTH IS MERELY A LARGE
VILLAGE AND HAS NO VERY LARGE HOTELS OR EATINGHOUSES THE PRINCIPAL
INNS ARE THE GOLDEN ANCHOR AND THE SUN AT EITHER OF THESE PLACES YOU
CAN GET AN EXCELLENT MEALNO I MEAN YOU CAN GO THERE AND SEE OTHER
PEOPLE GET IT THERE IS NO CHARGE FOR THIS THE TOWN IS LITTERED WITH
RESTAURANTS BUT THEY ARE SMALL AND BAD AND THEY ARE OVERDRIVEN WITH
CUSTOM YOU MUST SECURE A TABLE HOURS BEFOREHAND AND OFTEN WHEN YOU
ARRIVE YOU WILL FIND SOMEBODY OCCUPYING IT WE HAVE HAD THIS
EXPERIENCE WE HAVE HAD A DAILY SCRAMBLE FOR LIFE AND WHEN I SAY WE I
INCLUDE SHOALS OF PEOPLE I HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO DO NOT HAVE TO SCRAMBLE ARE THE VETERANSTHE DISCIPLES WHO HAVE
BEEN HERE BEFORE AND KNOW THE ROPES I THINK THEY ARRIVE ABOUT A WEEK
BEFORE THE FIRST OPERA AND ENGAGE ALL THE TABLES FOR THE SEASON MY
TRIBE HAD TRIED ALL KINDS OF PLACESSOME OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN A MILE OR
TWOAND HAVE CAPTURED ONLY NIBBLINGS AND ODDS AND ENDS NEVER IN ANY
INSTANCE A COMPLETE AND SATISFYING MEAL DIGESTIBLE NO THE REVERSE
THESE ODDS AND ENDS ARE GOING TO SERVE AS SOUVENIRS OF BAYREUTH AND IN
THAT REGARD THEIR VALUE IS NOT TO BE OVERESTIMATED PHOTOGRAPHS FADE
BRICABRAC GETS LOST BUSTS OF WAGNER GET BROKEN BUT ONCE YOU ABSORB
A BAYREUTHRESTAURANT MEAL IT IS YOUR POSSESSION AND YOUR PROPERTY
UNTIL THE TIME COMES TO EMBALM THE REST OF YOU SOME OF THESE PILGRIMS
HERE BECOME IN EFFECT CABINETS CABINETS OF SOUVENIRS OF BAYREUTH IT
IS BELIEVED AMONG SCIENTISTS THAT YOU COULD EXAMINE THE CROP OF A DEAD
BAYREUTH PILGRIM ANYWHERE IN THE EARTH AND TELL WHERE HE CAME FROM BUT
I LIKE THIS BALLAST I THINK A HERMITAGE SCRAPUP AT EIGHT IN THE
EVENING WHEN ALL THE FAMINEBREEDERS HAVE BEEN THERE AND LAID IN THEIR
MEMENTOES AND GONE IS THE QUIETEST THING YOU CAN LAY ON YOUR KEELSON
EXCEPT GRAVEL

THURSDAYTHEY KEEP TWO TEAMS OF SINGERS IN STOCK FOR THE CHIEF ROLES
AND ONE OF THESE IS COMPOSED OF THE MOST RENOWNED ARTISTS IN THE WORLD
WITH MATERNA AND ALVARY IN THE LEAD I SUPPOSE A DOUBLE TEAM IS
NECESSARY DOUBTLESS A SINGLE TEAM WOULD DIE OF EXHAUSTION IN A WEEK
FOR ALL THE PLAYS LAST FROM FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON TILL TEN AT NIGHT
NEARLY ALL THE LABOR FALLS UPON THE HALFDOZEN HEAD SINGERS AND
APPARENTLY THEY ARE REQUIRED TO FURNISH ALL THE NOISE THEY CAN FOR THE
MONEY IF THEY FEEL A SOFT WHISPERY MYSTERIOUS FEELING THEY ARE
REQUIRED TO OPEN OUT AND LET THE PUBLIC KNOW IT OPERAS ARE GIVEN ONLY
ON SUNDAYS MONDAYS WEDNESDAYS AND THURSDAYS WITH THREE DAYS OF
OSTENSIBLE REST PER WEEK AND TWO TEAMS TO DO THE FOUR OPERAS BUT THE
OSTENSIBLE REST IS DEVOTED LARGELY TO REHEARSING IT IS SAID THAT THE
OFF DAYS ARE DEVOTED TO REHEARSING FROM SOME TIME IN THE MORNING TILL
TEN AT NIGHT ARE THERE TWO ORCHESTRAS ALSO IT IS QUITE LIKELY SINCE
THERE ARE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN NAMES IN THE ORCHESTRA LIST

YESTERDAY THE OPERA WAS TRISTAN AND ISOLDE I HAVE SEEN ALL SORTS OF
AUDIENCESAT THEATERS OPERAS CONCERTS LECTURES SERMONS
FUNERALSBUT NONE WHICH WAS TWIN TO THE WAGNER AUDIENCE OF BAYREUTH FOR
FIXED AND REVERENTIAL ATTENTION ABSOLUTE ATTENTION AND PETRIFIED
RETENTION TO THE END OF AN ACT OF THE ATTITUDE ASSUMED AT THE BEGINNING
OF IT YOU DETECT NO MOVEMENT IN THE SOLID MASS OF HEADS AND SHOULDERS
YOU SEEM TO SIT WITH THE DEAD IN THE GLOOM OF A TOMB YOU KNOW THAT
THEY ARE BEING STIRRED TO THEIR PROFOUNDEST DEPTHS THAT THERE ARE
TIMES WHEN THEY WANT TO RISE AND WAVE HANDKERCHIEFS AND SHOUT THEIR
APPROBATION AND TIMES WHEN TEARS ARE RUNNING DOWN THEIR FACES AND IT
WOULD BE A RELIEF TO FREE THEIR PENT EMOTIONS IN SOBS OR SCREAMS YET
YOU HEAR NOT ONE UTTERANCE TILL THE CURTAIN SWINGS TOGETHER AND THE
CLOSING STRAINS HAVE SLOWLY FADED OUT AND DIED THEN THE DEAD RISE WITH
ONE IMPULSE AND SHAKE THE BUILDING WITH THEIR APPLAUSE EVERY SEAT IS
FULL IN THE FIRST ACT THERE IS NOT A VACANT ONE IN THE LAST IF A MAN
WOULD BE CONSPICUOUS LET HIM COME HERE AND RETIRE FROM THE HOUSE IN
THE MIDST OF AN ACT IT WOULD MAKE HIM CELEBRATED

THIS AUDIENCE REMINDS ME OF NOTHING I HAVE EVER SEEN AND OF NOTHING I
HAVE READ ABOUT EXCEPT THE CITY IN THE ARABIAN TALE WHERE ALL THE
INHABITANTS HAVE BEEN TURNED TO BRASS AND THE TRAVELER FINDS THEM AFTER
CENTURIES MUTE MOTIONLESS AND STILL RETAINING THE ATTITUDES WHICH
THEY LAST KNEW IN LIFE HERE THE WAGNER AUDIENCE DRESS AS THEY PLEASE
AND SIT IN THE DARK AND WORSHIP IN SILENCE AT THE METROPOLITAN IN NEW
YORK THEY SIT IN A GLARE AND WEAR THEIR SHOWIEST HARNESS THEY HUM
AIRS THEY SQUEAK FANS THEY TITTER AND THEY GABBLE ALL THE TIME IN
SOME OF THE BOXES THE CONVERSATION AND LAUGHTER ARE SO LOUD AS TO
DIVIDE THE ATTENTION OF THE HOUSE WITH THE STAGE IN LARGE MEASURE THE
METROPOLITAN IS A SHOWCASE FOR RICH FASHIONABLES WHO ARE NOT TRAINED
IN WAGNERIAN MUSIC AND HAVE NO REVERENCE FOR IT BUT WHO LIKE TO
PROMOTE ART AND SHOW THEIR CLOTHES

CAN THAT BE AN AGREEABLE ATMOSPHERE TO PERSONS IN WHOM THIS MUSIC
PRODUCES A SORT OF DIVINE ECSTASY AND TO WHOM ITS CREATOR IS A VERY
DEITY HIS STAGE A TEMPLE THE WORKS OF HIS BRAIN AND HANDS CONSECRATED
THINGS AND THE PARTAKING OF THEM WITH EYE AND EAR A SACRED SOLEMNITY
MANIFESTLY NO THEN PERHAPS THE TEMPORARY EXPATRIATION THE TEDIOUS
TRAVERSING OF SEAS AND CONTINENTS THE PILGRIMAGE TO BAYREUTH STANDS
EXPLAINED THESE DEVOTEES WOULD WORSHIP IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF DEVOTION
IT IS ONLY HERE THAT THEY CAN FIND IT WITHOUT FLECK OR BLEMISH OR ANY
WORLDLY POLLUTION IN THIS REMOTE VILLAGE THERE ARE NO SIGHTS TO SEE
THERE IS NO NEWSPAPER TO INTRUDE THE WORRIES OF THE DISTANT WORLD
THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON IT IS ALWAYS SUNDAY THE PILGRIM WENDS TO
HIS TEMPLE OUT OF TOWN SITS OUT HIS MOVING SERVICE RETURNS TO HIS BED
WITH HIS HEART AND SOUL AND HIS BODY EXHAUSTED BY LONG HOURS OF
TREMENDOUS EMOTION AND HE IS IN NO FIT CONDITION TO DO ANYTHING BUT TO
LIE TORPID AND SLOWLY GATHER BACK LIFE AND STRENGTH FOR THE NEXT
SERVICE THIS OPERA OF TRISTAN AND ISOLDE LAST NIGHT BROKE THE HEARTS
OF ALL WITNESSES WHO WERE OF THE FAITH AND I KNOW OF SOME WHO HAVE
HEARD OF MANY WHO COULD NOT SLEEP AFTER IT BUT CRIED THE NIGHT AWAY I
FEEL STRONGLY OUT OF PLACE HERE SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THE SANE PERSON
IN A COMMUNITY OF THE MAD SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THE ONE BLIND MAN
WHERE ALL OTHERS SEE THE ONE GROPING SAVAGE IN THE COLLEGE OF THE
LEARNED AND ALWAYS DURING SERVICE I FEEL LIKE A HERETIC IN HEAVEN

BUT BY NO MEANS DO I EVER OVERLOOK OR MINIFY THE FACT THAT THIS IS ONE
OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE I HAVE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING SO GREAT AND FINE
AND REAL AS THIS DEVOTION

FRIDAYYESTERDAYS OPERA WAS PARSIFAL AGAIN THE OTHERS WENT AND
THEY SHOW MARKED ADVANCE IN APPRECIATION BUT I WENT HUNTING FOR RELICS
AND REMINDERS OF THE MARGRAVINE WILHELMINA SHE OF THE IMPERISHABLE
MEMOIRS I AM PROPERLY GRATEFUL TO HER FOR HER UNCONSCIOUS SATIRE
UPON MONARCHY AND NOBILITY AND THEREFORE NOTHING WHICH HER HAND
TOUCHED OR HER EYE LOOKED UPON IS INDIFFERENT TO ME I AM HER PILGRIM
THE REST OF THIS MULTITUDE HERE ARE WAGNERS

TUESDAYI HAVE SEEN MY LAST TWO OPERAS MY SEASON IS ENDED AND WE
CROSS OVER INTO BOHEMIA THIS AFTERNOON I WAS SUPPOSING THAT MY MUSICAL
REGENERATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED AND PERFECTED BECAUSE I ENJOYED BOTH OF
THESE OPERAS SINGING AND ALL AND MOREOVER ONE OF THEM WAS
PARSIFAL BUT THE EXPERTS HAVE DISENCHANTED ME THEY SAY

SINGING THAT WASNT SINGING THAT WAS THE WAILING SCREECHING OF
THIRDRATE OBSCURITIES PALMED OFF ON US IN THE INTEREST OF ECONOMY

WELL I OUGHT TO HAVE RECOGNIZED THE SIGNTHE OLD SURE SIGN THAT HAS
NEVER FAILED ME IN MATTERS OF ART WHENEVER I ENJOY ANYTHING IN ART IT
MEANS THAT IT IS MIGHTY POOR THE PRIVATE KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FACT HAS
SAVED ME FROM GOING TO PIECES WITH ENTHUSIASM IN FRONT OF MANY AND MANY
A CHROMO HOWEVER MY BASE INSTINCT DOES BRING ME PROFIT SOMETIMES I
WAS THE ONLY MAN OUT OF THIRTYTWO HUNDRED WHO GOT HIS MONEY BACK ON
THOSE TWO OPERAS




WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS


IS IT TRUE THAT THE SUN OF A MANS MENTALITY TOUCHES NOON AT FORTY AND
THEN BEGINS TO WANE TOWARD SETTING DOCTOR OSLER IS CHARGED WITH SAYING
SO MAYBE HE SAID IT MAYBE HE DIDNT I DONT KNOW WHICH IT IS BUT IF
HE SAID IT I CAN POINT HIM TO A CASE WHICH PROVES HIS RULE PROVES IT
BY BEING AN EXCEPTION TO IT TO THIS PLACE I NOMINATE MR HOWELLS

I READ HIS VENETIAN DAYS ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO I COMPARE IT WITH HIS
PAPER ON MACHIAVELLI IN A LATE NUMBER OF HARPER AND I CANNOT FIND
THAT HIS ENGLISH HAS SUFFERED ANY IMPAIRMENT FOR FORTY YEARS HIS
ENGLISH HAS BEEN TO ME A CONTINUAL DELIGHT AND ASTONISHMENT IN THE
SUSTAINED EXHIBITION OF CERTAIN GREAT QUALITIESCLEARNESS COMPRESSION
VERBAL EXACTNESS AND UNFORCED AND SEEMINGLY UNCONSCIOUS FELICITY OF
PHRASINGHE IS IN MY BELIEF WITHOUT HIS PEER IN THE ENGLISHWRITING
WORLD SUSTAINED I ENTRENCH MYSELF BEHIND THAT PROTECTING WORD
THERE ARE OTHERS WHO EXHIBIT THOSE GREAT QUALITIES AS GREATLY AS HE
DOES BUT ONLY BY INTERVALED DISTRIBUTIONS OF RICH MOONLIGHT WITH
STRETCHES OF VEILED AND DIMMER LANDSCAPE BETWEEN WHEREAS HOWELLSS
MOON SAILS CLOUDLESS SKIES ALL NIGHT AND ALL THE NIGHTS

IN THE MATTER OF VERBAL EXACTNESS MR HOWELLS HAS NO SUPERIOR I
SUPPOSE HE SEEMS TO BE ALMOST ALWAYS ABLE TO FIND THAT ELUSIVE AND
SHIFTY GRAIN OF GOLD THE RIGHT WORD OTHERS HAVE TO PUT UP WITH
APPROXIMATIONS MORE OR LESS FREQUENTLY HE HAS BETTER LUCK TO ME THE
OTHERS ARE MINERS WORKING WITH THE GOLDPANOF NECESSITY SOME OF THE
GOLD WASHES OVER AND ESCAPES WHEREAS IN MY FANCY HE IS QUICKSILVER
RAIDING DOWN A RIFFLENO GRAIN OF THE METAL STANDS MUCH CHANCE OF
ELUDING HIM A POWERFUL AGENT IS THE RIGHT WORD IT LIGHTS THE READERS
WAY AND MAKES IT PLAIN A CLOSE APPROXIMATION TO IT WILL ANSWER AND
MUCH TRAVELING IS DONE IN A WELLENOUGH FASHION BY ITS HELP BUT WE DO
NOT WELCOME IT AND APPLAUD IT AND REJOICE IN IT AS WE DO WHEN THE
RIGHT ONE BLAZES OUT ON US WHENEVER WE COME UPON ONE OF THOSE
INTENSELY RIGHT WORDS IN A BOOK OR A NEWSPAPER THE RESULTING EFFECT IS
PHYSICAL AS WELL AS SPIRITUAL AND ELECTRICALLY PROMPT IT TINGLES
EXQUISITELY AROUND THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE MOUTH AND TASTES AS TART
AND CRISP AND GOOD AS THE AUTUMNBUTTER THAT CREAMS THE SUMACBERRY
ONE HAS NO TIME TO EXAMINE THE WORD AND VOTE UPON ITS RANK AND
STANDING THE AUTOMATIC RECOGNITION OF ITS SUPREMACY IS SO IMMEDIATE
THERE IS A PLENTY OF ACCEPTABLE LITERATURE WHICH DEALS LARGELY IN
APPROXIMATIONS BUT IT MAY BE LIKENED TO A FINE LANDSCAPE SEEN THROUGH
THE RAIN THE RIGHT WORD WOULD DISMISS THE RAIN THEN YOU WOULD SEE IT
BETTER IT DOESNT RAIN WHEN HOWELLS IS AT WORK

AND WHERE DOES HE GET THE EASY AND EFFORTLESS FLOW OF HIS SPEECH AND
ITS CADENCED AND UNDULATING RHYTHM AND ITS ARCHITECTURAL FELICITIES OF
CONSTRUCTION ITS GRACES OF EXPRESSION ITS PEMMICAN QUALITY OF
COMPRESSION AND ALL THAT BORN TO HIM NO DOUBT ALL IN SHINING GOOD
ORDER IN THE BEGINNING ALL EXTRAORDINARY AND ALL JUST AS SHINING
JUST AS EXTRAORDINARY TODAY AFTER FORTY YEARS OF DILIGENT WEAR AND
TEAR AND USE HE PASSED HIS FORTIETH YEAR LONG AND LONG AGO BUT I
THINK HIS ENGLISH OF TODAYHIS PERFECT ENGLISH I WISH TO SAYCAN THROW
DOWN THE GLOVE BEFORE HIS ENGLISH OF THAT ANTIQUE TIME AND NOT BE
AFRAID

I WILL GO BACK TO THE PAPER ON MACHIAVELLI NOW AND ASK THE READER TO
EXAMINE THIS PASSAGE FROM IT WHICH I APPEND I DO NOT MEAN EXAMINE IT
IN A BIRDSEYE WAY I MEAN SEARCH IT STUDY IT AND OF COURSE READ
IT ALOUD I MAY BE WRONG STILL IT IS MY CONVICTION THAT ONE CANNOT GET
OUT OF FINELY WROUGHT LITERATURE ALL THAT IS IN IT BY READING IT
MUTELY

MR DYER IS RATHER OF THE OPINION FIRST LUMINOUSLY SUGGESTED BY
MACAULAY THAT MACHIAVELLI WAS IN EARNEST BUT MUST NOT BE JUDGED AS A
POLITICAL MORALIST OF OUR TIME AND RACE WOULD BE JUDGED HE THINKS THAT
MACHIAVELLI WAS IN EARNEST AS NONE BUT AN IDEALIST CAN BE AND HE IS
THE FIRST TO IMAGINE HIM AN IDEALIST IMMERSED IN REALITIES WHO
INVOLUNTARILY TRANSMUTES THE EVENTS UNDER HIS EYE INTO SOMETHING LIKE
THE VISIONARY ISSUES OF REVERIE THE MACHIAVELLI WHOM HE DEPICTS DOES
NOT CEASE TO BE POLITICALLY A REPUBLICAN AND SOCIALLY A JUST MAN
BECAUSE HE HOLDS UP AN ATROCIOUS DESPOT LIKE CAESAR BORGIA AS A MIRROR
FOR RULERS WHAT MACHIAVELLI BEHELD ROUND HIM IN ITALY WAS A CIVIC
DISORDER IN WHICH THERE WAS OPPRESSION WITHOUT STATECRAFT AND REVOLT
WITHOUT PATRIOTISM WHEN A MISCREANT LIKE BORGIA APPEARED UPON THE
SCENE AND REDUCED BOTH TYRANTS AND REBELS TO AN APPARENT QUIESCENCE HE
MIGHT VERY WELL SEEM TO SUCH A DREAMER THE SAVIOR OF SOCIETY WHOM A
CERTAIN SORT OF DREAMERS ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR MACHIAVELLI WAS NO
LESS HONEST WHEN HE HONORED THE DIABOLICAL FORCE OF CAESAR BORGIA THAN
CARLYLE WAS WHEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES HE EXTOLLED THE STRONG MAN WHO
DESTROYS LIBERTY IN CREATING ORDER BUT CARLYLE HAS ONLY JUST CEASED TO
BE MISTAKEN FOR A REFORMER WHILE IT IS STILL MACHIAVELLIS HARD FATE
TO BE SO TRAMMELED IN HIS MATERIAL THAT HIS NAME STANDS FOR WHATEVER IS
MOST MALEVOLENT AND PERFIDIOUS IN HUMAN NATURE

YOU SEE HOW EASY AND FLOWING IT IS HOW UNVEXED BY RUGGEDNESSES
CLUMSINESSES BROKEN METERS HOW SIMPLE ANDSO FAR AS YOU OR I CAN MAKE
OUTUNSTUDIED HOW CLEAR HOW LIMPID HOW UNDERSTANDABLE HOW
UNCONFUSED BY CROSSCURRENTS EDDIES UNDERTOWS HOW SEEMINGLY
UNADORNED YET IS ALL ADORNMENT LIKE THE LILYOFTHEVALLEY AND HOW
COMPRESSED HOW COMPACT WITHOUT A COMPLACENCYSIGNAL HUNG OUT ANYWHERE
TO CALL ATTENTION TO IT

THERE ARE TWENTYTHREE LINES IN THE QUOTED PASSAGE AFTER READING IT
SEVERAL TIMES ALOUD ONE PERCEIVES THAT A GOOD DEAL OF MATTER IS
CROWDED INTO THAT SMALL SPACE I THINK IT IS A MODEL OF COMPACTNESS
WHEN I TAKE ITS MATERIALS APART AND WORK THEM OVER AND PUT THEM
TOGETHER IN MY WAY I FIND I CANNOT CROWD THE RESULT BACK INTO THE SAME
HOLE THERE NOT BEING ROOM ENOUGH I FIND IT A CASE OF A WOMAN PACKING
A MANS TRUNK HE CAN GET THE THINGS OUT BUT HE CANT EVER GET THEM
BACK AGAIN

THE PROFFERED PARAGRAPH IS A JUST AND FAIR SAMPLE THE REST OF THE
ARTICLE IS AS COMPACT AS IT IS THERE ARE NO WASTE WORDS THE SAMPLE IS
JUST IN OTHER WAYS LIMPID FLUENT GRACEFUL AND RHYTHMICAL AS IT IS
IT HOLDS NO SUPERIORITY IN THESE RESPECTS OVER THE REST OF THE ESSAY
ALSO THE CHOICE PHRASING NOTICEABLE IN THE SAMPLE IS NOT LONELY THERE
IS A PLENTY OF ITS KIN DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE OTHER PARAGRAPHS THIS
IS CLAIMING MUCH WHEN THAT KIN MUST FACE THE CHALLENGE OF A PHRASE LIKE
THE ONE IN THE MIDDLE SENTENCE AN IDEALIST IMMERSED IN REALITIES WHO
INVOLUNTARILY TRANSMUTES THE EVENTS UNDER HIS EYE INTO SOMETHING LIKE
THE VISIONARY ISSUES OF REVERIE WITH A HUNDRED WORDS TO DO IT WITH
THE LITERARY ARTISAN COULD CATCH THAT AIRY THOUGHT AND TIE IT DOWN AND
REDUCE IT TO A CONCRETE CONDITION VISIBLE SUBSTANTIAL UNDERSTANDABLE
AND ALL RIGHT LIKE A CABBAGE BUT THE ARTIST DOES IT WITH TWENTY AND
THE RESULT IS A FLOWER

THE QUOTED PHRASE LIKE A THOUSAND OTHERS THAT HAVE COME FROM THE SAME
SOURCE HAS THE QUALITY OF CERTAIN SCRAPS OF VERSE WHICH TAKE HOLD OF
US AND STAY IN OUR MEMORIES WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY AT FIRST ALL
THE WORDS BEING THE RIGHT WORDS NONE OF THEM IS CONSPICUOUS AND SO
THEY ALL SEEM INCONSPICUOUS THEREFORE WE WONDER WHAT IT IS ABOUT THEM
THAT MAKES THEIR MESSAGE TAKE HOLD

THE MOSSY MARBLES REST
ON THE LIPS THAT HE HAS PREST
IN THEIR BLOOM
AND THE NAMES HE LOVED TO HEAR
HAVE BEEN CARVED FOR MANY A YEAR
ON THE TOMB


IT IS LIKE A DREAMY STRAIN OF MOVING MUSIC WITH NO SHARP NOTES IN IT
THE WORDS ARE ALL RIGHT WORDS AND ALL THE SAME SIZE WE DO NOT
NOTICE IT AT FIRST WE GET THE EFFECT IT GOES STRAIGHT HOME TO US BUT
WE DO NOT KNOW WHY IT IS WHEN THE RIGHT WORDS ARE CONSPICUOUS THAT
THEY THUNDER

THE GLORY THAT WAS GREECE AND THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME

WHEN I GO BACK FROM HOWELLS OLD TO HOWELLS YOUNG I FIND HIM ARRANGING
AND CLUSTERING ENGLISH WORDS WELL BUT NOT ANY BETTER THAN NOW HE IS
NOT MORE FELICITOUS IN CONCRETING ABSTRACTIONS NOW THAN HE WAS IN
TRANSLATING THEN THE VISIONS OF THE EYES OF FLESH INTO WORDS THAT
REPRODUCED THEIR FORMS AND COLORS

IN VENETIAN STREETS THEY GIVE THE FALLEN SNOW NO REST IT IS AT ONCE
SHOVELED INTO THE CANALS BY HUNDREDS OF HALFNAKED FACCHINI AND NOW IN
ST MARKS PLACE THE MUSIC OF INNUMERABLE SHOVELS SMOTE UPON MY EAR
AND I SAW THE SHIVERING LEGION OF POVERTY AS IT ENGAGED THE ELEMENTS IN
A STRUGGLE FOR THE POSSESSION OF THE PIAZZA BUT THE SNOW CONTINUED TO
FALL AND THROUGH THE TWILIGHT OF THE DESCENDING FLAKES ALL THIS TOIL
AND ENCOUNTER LOOKED LIKE THAT WEARY KIND OF EFFORT IN DREAMS WHEN THE
MOST DETERMINED INDUSTRY SEEMS ONLY TO RENEW THE TASK THE LOFTY CREST
OF THE BELLTOWER WAS HIDDEN IN THE FOLDS OF FALLING SNOW AND I COULD
NO LONGER SEE THE GOLDEN ANGEL UPON ITS SUMMIT BUT LOOKED AT ACROSS
THE PIAZZA THE BEAUTIFUL OUTLINE OF ST MARKS CHURCH WAS PERFECTLY
PENCILED IN THE AIR AND THE SHIFTING THREADS OF THE SNOWFALL WERE
WOVEN INTO A SPELL OF NOVEL ENCHANTMENT AROUND THE STRUCTURE THAT
ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME TOO EXQUISITE IN ITS FANTASTIC LOVELINESS TO BE
ANYTHING BUT THE CREATION OF MAGIC THE TENDER SNOW HAD COMPASSIONATED
THE BEAUTIFUL EDIFICE FOR ALL THE WRONGS OF TIME AND SO HID THE STAINS
AND UGLINESS OF DECAY THAT IT LOOKED AS IF JUST FROM THE HAND OF THE
BUILDEROR BETTER SAID JUST FROM THE BRAIN OF THE ARCHITECT THERE
WAS MARVELOUS FRESHNESS IN THE COLORS OF THE MOSAICS IN THE GREAT
ARCHES OF THE FACADE AND ALL THAT GRACIOUS HARMONY INTO WHICH THE
TEMPLE RISES OF MARBLE SCROLLS AND LEAFY EXUBERANCE AIRILY SUPPORTING
THE STATUES OF THE SAINTS WAS A HUNDRED TIMES ETHEREALIZED BY THE
PURITY AND WHITENESS OF THE DRIFTING FLAKES THE SNOW LAY LIGHTLY ON
THE GOLDEN GLOBES THAT TREMBLE LIKE PEACOCKSCRESTS ABOVE THE VAST
DOMES AND PLUMED THEM WITH SOFTEST WHITE IT ROBED THE SAINTS IN
ERMINE AND IT DANCED OVER ALL ITS WORKS AS IF EXULTING IN ITS
BEAUTYBEAUTY WHICH FILLED ME WITH SUBTLE SELFISH YEARNING TO KEEP
SUCH EVANESCENT LOVELINESS FOR THE LITTLEWHILELONGER OF MY WHOLE
LIFE AND WITH DESPAIR TO THINK THAT EVEN THE POOR LIFELESS SHADOW OF
IT COULD NEVER BE FAIRLY REFLECTED IN PICTURE OR POEM

THROUGH THE WAVERING SNOWFALL THE SAINT THEODORE UPON ONE OF THE
GRANITE PILLARS OF THE PIAZZETTA DID NOT SHOW SO GRIM AS HIS WONT IS
AND THE WINGED LION ON THE OTHER MIGHT HAVE BEEN A WINGED LAMB SO
GENTLE AND MILD HE LOOKED BY THE TENDER LIGHT OF THE STORM THE TOWERS
OF THE ISLAND CHURCHES LOOMED FAINT AND FAR AWAY IN THE DIMNESS THE
SAILORS IN THE RIGGING OF THE SHIPS THAT LAY IN THE BASIN WROUGHT LIKE
PHANTOMS AMONG THE SHROUDS THE GONDOLAS STOLE IN AND OUT OF THE OPAQUE
DISTANCE MORE NOISELESSLY AND DREAMILY THAN EVER AND A SILENCE ALMOST
PALPABLE LAY UPON THE MUTEST CITY IN THE WORLD

THE SPIRIT OF VENICE IS THERE OF A CITY WHERE AGE AND DECAY FAGGED
WITH DISTRIBUTING DAMAGE AND REPULSIVENESS AMONG THE OTHER CITIES OF
THE PLANET IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICY AND BUSINESS OF THEIR
PROFESSION COME FOR REST AND PLAY BETWEEN SEASONS AND TREAT
THEMSELVES TO THE LUXURY AND RELAXATION OF SINKING THE SHOP AND
INVENTING AND SQUANDERING CHARMS ALL ABOUT INSTEAD OF ABOLISHING SUCH
AS THEY FIND AS IS THEIR HABIT WHEN NOT ON VACATION

IN THE WORKING SEASON THEY DO BUSINESS IN BOSTON SOMETIMES AND A
CHARACTER IN THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY TAKES ACCURATE NOTE OF PATHETIC
EFFECTS WROUGHT BY THEM UPON THE ASPECTS OF A STREET OF ONCE DIGNIFIED
AND ELEGANT HOMES WHOSE OCCUPANTS HAVE MOVED AWAY AND LEFT THEM A PREY
TO NEGLECT AND GRADUAL RUIN AND PROGRESSIVE DEGRADATION A DESCENT
WHICH REACHES BOTTOM AT LAST WHEN THE STREET BECOMES A ROOST FOR
HUMBLE PROFESSIONALS OF THE FAITHCURE AND FORTUNETELLING SORT

WHAT A QUEER MELANCHOLY HOUSE WHAT A QUEER MELANCHOLY STREET I
DONT THINK I WAS EVER IN A STREET BEFORE WHERE QUITE SO MANY
PROFESSIONAL LADIES WITH ENGLISH SURNAMES PREFERRED MADAM TO MRS ON
THEIR DOORPLATES AND THE POOR OLD PLACE HAS SUCH A DESPERATELY
CONSCIOUS AIR OF GOING TO THE DEUCE EVERY HOUSE SEEMS TO WINCE AS YOU
GO BY AND BUTTON ITSELF UP TO THE CHIN FOR FEAR YOU SHOULD FIND OUT IT
HAD NO SHIRT ONSO TO SPEAK I DONT KNOW WHATS THE REASON BUT THESE
MATERIAL TOKENS OF A SOCIAL DECAY AFFLICT ME TERRIBLY A TIPSY WOMAN
ISNT DREADFULER THAN A HAGGARD OLD HOUSE THATS ONCE BEEN A HOME IN
A STREET LIKE THIS

MR HOWELLSS PICTURES ARE NOT MERE STIFF HARD ACCURATE PHOTOGRAPHS
THEY ARE PHOTOGRAPHS WITH FEELING IN THEM AND SENTIMENT PHOTOGRAPHS
TAKEN IN A DREAM ONE MIGHT SAY

AS CONCERNS HIS HUMOR I WILL NOT TRY TO SAY ANYTHING YET I WOULD TRY
IF I HAD THE WORDS THAT MIGHT APPROXIMATELY REACH UP TO ITS HIGH PLACE
I DO NOT THINK ANY ONE ELSE CAN PLAY WITH HUMOROUS FANCIES SO
GRACEFULLY AND DELICATELY AND DELICIOUSLY AS HE DOES NOR HAS SO MANY
TO PLAY WITH NOR CAN COME SO NEAR MAKING THEM LOOK AS IF THEY WERE
DOING THE PLAYING THEMSELVES AND HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT THEY WERE AT IT
FOR THEY ARE UNOBTRUSIVE AND QUIET IN THEIR WAYS AND WELL CONDUCTED
HIS IS A HUMOR WHICH FLOWS SOFTLY ALL AROUND ABOUT AND OVER AND THROUGH
THE MESH OF THE PAGE PERVASIVE REFRESHING HEALTHGIVING AND MAKES
NO MORE SHOW AND NO MORE NOISE THAN DOES THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD

THERE IS ANOTHER THING WHICH IS CONTENTINGLY NOTICEABLE IN MR
HOWELLSS BOOKS THAT IS HIS STAGE DIRECTIONSTHOSE ARTIFICES WHICH
AUTHORS EMPLOY TO THROW A KIND OF HUMAN NATURALNESS AROUND A SCENE AND
A CONVERSATION AND HELP THE READER TO SEE THE ONE AND GET AT MEANINGS
IN THE OTHER WHICH MIGHT NOT BE PERCEIVED IF ENTRUSTED UNEXPLAINED TO
THE BARE WORDS OF THE TALK SOME AUTHORS OVERDO THE STAGE DIRECTIONS
THEY ELABORATE THEM QUITE BEYOND NECESSITY THEY SPEND SO MUCH TIME AND
TAKE UP SO MUCH ROOM IN TELLING US HOW A PERSON SAID A THING AND HOW HE
LOOKED AND ACTED WHEN HE SAID IT THAT WE GET TIRED AND VEXED AND WISH
HE HADNT SAID IT AT ALL OTHER AUTHORS DIRECTIONS ARE BRIEF ENOUGH
BUT IT IS SELDOM THAT THE BREVITY CONTAINS EITHER WIT OR INFORMATION
WRITERS OF THIS SCHOOL GO IN RAGS IN THE MATTER OF STAGE DIRECTIONS
THE MAJORITY OF THEM HAVING NOTHING IN STOCK BUT A CIGAR A LAUGH A
BLUSH AND A BURSTING INTO TEARS IN THEIR POVERTY THEY WORK THESE
SORRY THINGS TO THE BONE THEY SAY

REPLIED ALFRED FLIPPING THE ASH FROM HIS CIGAR THIS EXPLAINS
NOTHING IT ONLY WASTES SPACE

RESPONDED RICHARD WITH A LAUGH THERE WAS NOTHING TO LAUGH
ABOUT THERE NEVER IS THE WRITER PUTS IT IN FROM HABITAUTOMATICALLY
HE IS PAYING NO ATTENTION TO HIS WORK OR HE WOULD SEE THAT THERE IS
NOTHING TO LAUGH AT OFTEN WHEN A REMARK IS UNUSUALLY AND POIGNANTLY
FLAT AND SILLY HE TRIES TO DECEIVE THE READER BY ENLARGING THE STAGE
DIRECTION AND MAKING RICHARD BREAK INTO FRENZIES OF UNCONTROLLABLE
LAUGHTER THIS MAKES THE READER SAD

MURMURED GLADYS BLUSHING THIS POOR OLD SHOPWORN BLUSH IS A
TIRESOME THING WE GET SO WE WOULD RATHER GLADYS WOULD FALL OUT OF THE
BOOK AND BREAK HER NECK THAN DO IT AGAIN SHE IS ALWAYS DOING IT AND
USUALLY IRRELEVANTLY WHENEVER IT IS HER TURN TO MURMUR SHE HANGS OUT
HER BLUSH IT IS THE ONLY THING SHES GOT IN A LITTLE WHILE WE HATE
HER JUST AS WE DO RICHARD

REPEATED EVELYN BURSTING INTO TEARS THIS KIND KEEP A BOOK DAMP
ALL THE TIME THEY CANT SAY A THING WITHOUT CRYING THEY CRY SO MUCH
ABOUT NOTHING THAT BY AND BY WHEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO CRY ABOUT THEY
HAVE GONE DRY THEY SOB AND FETCH NOTHING WE ARE NOT MOVED WE ARE
ONLY GLAD

THEY GRAVEL ME THESE STALE AND OVERWORKED STAGE DIRECTIONS THESE
CARBON FILMS THAT GOT BURNT OUT LONG AGO AND CANNOT NOW CARRY ANY
FAINTEST THREAD OF LIGHT IT WOULD BE WELL IF THEY COULD BE RELIEVED
FROM DUTY AND FLUNG OUT IN THE LITERARY BACK YARD TO ROT AND DISAPPEAR
ALONG WITH THE DISCARDED AND FORGOTTEN STEEDS AND HALIDOMES AND
SIMILAR STAGEPROPERTIES ONCE SO DEAR TO OUR GRANDFATHERS BUT I AM
FRIENDLY TO MR HOWELLSS STAGE DIRECTIONS MORE FRIENDLY TO THEM THAN
TO ANY ONE ELSES I THINK THEY ARE DONE WITH A COMPETENT AND
DISCRIMINATING ART AND ARE FAITHFUL TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF A STAGE
DIRECTIONS PROPER AND LAWFUL OFFICE WHICH IS TO INFORM SOMETIMES
THEY CONVEY A SCENE AND ITS CONDITIONS SO WELL THAT I BELIEVE I COULD
SEE THE SCENE AND GET THE SPIRIT AND MEANING OF THE ACCOMPANYING
DIALOGUE IF SOME ONE WOULD READ MERELY THE STAGE DIRECTIONS TO ME AND
LEAVE OUT THE TALK FOR INSTANCE A SCENE LIKE THIS FROM THE
UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY

AND SHE LAID HER ARMS WITH A BESEECHING GESTURE ON HER FATHERS
SHOULDER

SHE ANSWERED FOLLOWING HIS GESTURE WITH A GLANCE

SHE SAID LAUGHING NERVOUSLY

SHE ASKED TURNING SWIFTLY UPON HIM THAT STRANGE SEARCHING
GLANCE

SHE ANSWERED VAGUELY

SHE RELUCTANTLY ADMITTED

BUT HER VOICE DIED WEARILY AWAY AND SHE STOOD LOOKING INTO HIS
FACE WITH PUZZLED ENTREATY

MR HOWELLS DOES NOT REPEAT HIS FORMS AND DOES NOT NEED TO HE CAN
INVENT FRESH ONES WITHOUT LIMIT IT IS MAINLY THE REPETITION OVER AND
OVER AGAIN BY THE THIRDRATES OF WORN AND COMMONPLACE AND JUICELESS
FORMS THAT MAKES THEIR NOVELS SUCH A WEARINESS AND VEXATION TO US I
THINK WE DO NOT MIND ONE OR TWO DELIVERIES OF THEIR WARES BUT AS WE
TURN THE PAGES OVER AND KEEP ON MEETING THEM WE PRESENTLY GET TIRED OF
THEM AND WISH THEY WOULD DO OTHER THINGS FOR A CHANGE

REPLIED ALFRED FLIPPING THE ASH FROM HIS CIGAR

RESPONDED RICHARD WITH A LAUGH

MURMURED GLADYS BLUSHING

REPEATED EVELYN BURSTING INTO TEARS

REPLIED THE EARL FLIPPING THE ASH FROM HIS CIGAR

RESPONDED THE UNDERTAKER WITH A LAUGH

MURMURED THE CHAMBERMAID BLUSHING

REPEATED THE BURGLAR BURSTING INTO TEARS

REPLIED THE CONDUCTOR FLIPPING THE ASH FROM HIS CIGAR

RESPONDED ARKWRIGHT WITH A LAUGH

MURMURED THE CHIEF OF POLICE BLUSHING

REPEATED THE HOUSECAT BURSTING INTO TEARS

AND SO ON AND SO ON TILL AT LAST IT CEASES TO EXCITE I ALWAYS NOTICE
STAGE DIRECTIONS BECAUSE THEY FRET ME AND KEEP ME TRYING TO GET OUT OF
THEIR WAY JUST AS THE AUTOMOBILES DO AT FIRST THEN BY AND BY THEY
BECOME MONOTONOUS AND I GET RUN OVER

MR HOWELLS HAS DONE MUCH WORK AND THE SPIRIT OF IT IS AS BEAUTIFUL AS
THE MAKE OF IT I HAVE HELD HIM IN ADMIRATION AND AFFECTION SO MANY
YEARS THAT I KNOW BY THE NUMBER OF THOSE YEARS THAT HE IS OLD NOW BUT
HIS HEART ISNT NOR HIS PEN AND YEARS DO NOT COUNT LET HIM HAVE
PLENTY OF THEM THERE IS PROFIT IN THEM FOR US




ENGLISH AS SHE IS TAUGHT


IN THE APPENDIX TO CROKERS BOSWELLS JOHNSON ONE FINDS THIS ANECDOTE

CATOS SOLILOQUYONE DAY MRS GASTREL SET A LITTLE GIRL TO REPEAT TO
HIM DR SAMUEL JOHNSON CATOS SOLILOQUY WHICH SHE WENT THROUGH VERY
CORRECTLY THE DOCTOR AFTER A PAUSE ASKED THE CHILD

WHAT WAS TO BRING CATO TO AN END

SHE SAID IT WAS A KNIFE

NO MY DEAR IT WAS NOT SO

MY AUNT POLLY SAID IT WAS A KNIFE

WHY AUNT POLLYS KNIFE MAY DO BUT IT WAS A DAGGER MY DEAR

HE THEN ASKED HER THE MEANING OF BANE AND ANTIDOTE WHICH SHE WAS
UNABLE TO GIVE MRS GASTREL SAID

YOU CANNOT EXPECT SO YOUNG A CHILD TO KNOW THE MEANING OF SUCH WORDS

HE THEN SAID

MY DEAR HOW MANY PENCE ARE THERE IN SIXPENCE

I CANNOT TELL SIR WAS THE HALFTERRIFIED REPLY

ON THIS ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO MRS GASTREL HE SAID

NOW MY DEAR LADY CAN ANYTHING BE MORE RIDICULOUS THAN TO TEACH A
CHILD CATOS SOLILOQUY WHO DOES NOT KNOW HOW MANY PENCE THERE ARE IN
SIXPENCE

IN A LECTURE BEFORE THE ROYAL GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY PROFESSOR RAVENSTEIN
QUOTED THE FOLLOWING LIST OF FRANTIC QUESTIONS AND SAID THAT THEY HAD
BEEN ASKED IN AN EXAMINATION

MENTION ALL THE NAMES OF PLACES IN THE WORLD DERIVED FROM JULIUS CAESAR
OR AUGUSTUS CAESAR

WHERE ARE THE FOLLOWING RIVERS PISUERGA SAKARIA GUADALETE JALON
MULDE

ALL YOU KNOW OF THE FOLLOWING MACHACHA PILMO SCHEBULOS CRIVOSCIA
BASECS MANCIKERT TAXHEM CITEAUX MELORIA ZUTPHEN

THE HIGHEST PEAKS OF THE KARAKORUM RANGE

THE NUMBER OF UNIVERSITIES IN PRUSSIA

WHY ARE THE TOPS OF MOUNTAINS CONTINUALLY COVERED WITH SNOW SIC

NAME THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF THE STREAMS OF LAVA WHICH ISSUED FROM
THE SKAPTAR JOKUL IN THE ERUPTION OF

THAT LIST WOULD OVERSIZE NEARLY ANYBODYS GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE ISNT
IT REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IN OUR SCHOOLS MANY OF THE QUESTIONS IN ALL
STUDIES ARE SEVERAL MILES AHEAD OF WHERE THE PUPIL ISTHAT HE IS SET
TO STRUGGLE WITH THINGS THAT ARE LUDICROUSLY BEYOND HIS PRESENT REACH
HOPELESSLY BEYOND HIS PRESENT STRENGTH THIS REMARK IN PASSING AND BY
WAY OF TEXT NOW I COME TO WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY

I HAVE JUST NOW FALLEN UPON A DARLING LITERARY CURIOSITY IT IS A
LITTLE BOOK A MANUSCRIPT COMPILATION AND THE COMPILER SENT IT TO ME
WITH THE REQUEST THAT I SAY WHETHER I THINK IT OUGHT TO BE PUBLISHED OR
NOT I SAID YES BUT AS I SLOWLY GROW WISE I BRISKLY GROW CAUTIOUS
AND SO NOW THAT THE PUBLICATION IS IMMINENT IT HAS SEEMED TO ME THAT
I SHOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IF I COULD DIVIDE UP THIS RESPONSIBILITY
WITH THE PUBLIC BY ADDING THEM TO THE COURT THEREFORE I WILL PRINT
SOME EXTRACTS FROM THE BOOK IN THE HOPE THAT THEY MAY MAKE CONVERTS TO
MY JUDGMENT THAT THE VOLUME HAS MERIT WHICH ENTITLES IT TO PUBLICATION

AS TO ITS CHARACTER EVERY ONE HAS SAMPLED ENGLISH AS SHE IS SPOKE
AND ENGLISH AS SHE IS WROTE THIS LITTLE VOLUME FURNISHES US AN
INSTRUCTIVE ARRAY OF EXAMPLES OF ENGLISH AS SHE IS TAUGHTIN THE
PUBLIC SCHOOLS OFWELL THIS COUNTRY THE COLLECTION IS MADE BY A
TEACHER IN THOSE SCHOOLS AND ALL THE EXAMPLES IN IT ARE GENUINE NONE
OF THEM HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH OR DOCTORED IN ANY WAY FROM TIME TO
TIME DURING SEVERAL YEARS WHENEVER A PUPIL HAS DELIVERED HIMSELF OF
ANYTHING PECULIARLY QUAINT OR TOOTHSOME IN THE COURSE OF HIS
RECITATIONS THIS TEACHER AND HER ASSOCIATES HAVE PRIVATELY SET THAT
THING DOWN IN A MEMORANDUMBOOK STRICTLY FOLLOWING THE ORIGINAL AS TO
GRAMMAR CONSTRUCTION SPELLING AND ALL AND THE RESULT IS THIS
LITERARY CURIOSITY

THE CONTENTS OF THE BOOK CONSIST MAINLY OF ANSWERS GIVEN BY THE BOYS
AND GIRLS TO QUESTIONS SAID ANSWERS BEING GIVEN SOMETIMES VERBALLY
SOMETIMES IN WRITING THE SUBJECTS TOUCHED UPON ARE FIFTEEN IN NUMBER
I ETYMOLOGY II GRAMMAR III MATHEMATICS IV GEOGRAPHY V
ORIGINAL VI ANALYSIS VII HISTORY VIII INTELLECTUAL IX
PHILOSOPHY X PHYSIOLOGY XI ASTRONOMY XII POLITICS XIII MUSIC
XIV ORATORY XV METAPHYSICS

YOU PERCEIVE THAT THE POOR LITTLE YOUNG IDEA HAS TAKEN A SHOT AT A GOOD
MANY KINDS OF GAME IN THE COURSE OF THE BOOK NOW AS TO RESULTS HERE
ARE SOME QUAINT DEFINITIONS OF WORDS IT WILL BE NOTICED THAT IN ALL OF
THESE INSTANCES THE SOUND OF THE WORD OR THE LOOK OF IT ON PAPER HAS
MISLED THE CHILD

IN THE CHILDS MIND WITH POLITICS AND THE RESULT IS A DEFINITION WHICH
TAKES ONE IN A SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED WAY

REPUBLICAN A SINNER MENTIONED IN THE BIBLE

ALSO IN DEMOCRATIC NEWSPAPERS NOW AND THEN HERE ARE TWO WHERE THE
MISTAKE HAS RESULTED FROM SOUND ASSISTED BY REMOTE FACT

PLAGIARIST A WRITER OF PLAYS

DEMAGOGUE A VESSEL CONTAINING BEER AND OTHER LIQUIDS

I CANNOT QUITE MAKE OUT WHAT IT WAS THAT MISLED THE PUPIL IN THE
FOLLOWING INSTANCES IT WOULD NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THE SOUND OF THE
WORD NOR THE LOOK OF IT IN PRINT

ASPHYXIA A GRUMBLING FUSSY TEMPER

QUARTERNIONS A BIRD WITH A FLAT BEAK AND NO BILL LIVING IN NEW
ZEALAND

QUARTERNIONS THE NAME GIVEN TO A STYLE OF ART PRACTICED BY THE

SHE WAS VERY QUICK AT REPERTOIRE

WITHOUT EVER SUSPECTING IT

THE MEN EMPLOYED BY THE GAS COMPANY GO AROUND AND SPECULATE THE METER

INDEED THEY DO DEAR AND WHEN YOU GROW UP MANY AND MANYS THE TIME
YOU WILL NOTICE IT IN THE GAS BILL IN THE FOLLOWING SENTENCES THE
LITTLE PEOPLE HAVE SOME INFORMATION TO CONVEY EVERY TIME BUT IN MY
CASE THEY FAIL TO CONNECT THE LIGHT ALWAYS WENT OUT ON THE KEYSTONE
WORD

THE COERCION OF SOME THINGS IS REMARKABLE AS BREAD AND MOLASSES

HER HAT IS CONTIGUOUS BECAUSE SHE WEARS IT ON ONE SIDE

HE PREACHED TO AN EGREGIOUS CONGREGATION

THE CAPTAIN ELIMINATED A BULLET THROUGH THE MANS HEART

YOU SHOULD TAKE CAUTION AND BE PRECARIOUS

THE SUPERCILIOUS GIRL ACTED WITH VICISSITUDE WHEN THE PERENNIAL TIME
CAME

THE LAST IS A CURIOUSLY PLAUSIBLE SENTENCE ONE SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT IT
MEANS AND YET HE KNOWS ALL THE TIME THAT HE DOESNT HERE IS AN ODD
BUT ENTIRELY PROPER USE OF A WORD AND A MOST SUDDEN DESCENT FROM A
LOFTY PHILOSOPHICAL ALTITUDE TO A VERY PRACTICAL AND HOMELY
ILLUSTRATION

WE SHOULD ENDEAVOR TO AVOID EXTREMESLIKE THOSE OF WASPS AND BEES

AND HEREWITH ZOOLOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL IN HIS MIND BUT NOT READY
TO HIS TONGUETHE SMALL SCHOLAR HAS INNOCENTLY GONE AND LET OUT A
COUPLE OF SECRETS WHICH OUGHT NEVER TO HAVE BEEN DIVULGED IN ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES

THERE ARE A GOOD MANY DONKEYS IN THEOLOGICAL GARDENS
SOME OF THE BEST FOSSILS ARE FOUND IN THEOLOGICAL CABINETS


UNDER THE HEAD OF GRAMMAR THE LITTLE SCHOLARS FURNISH THE FOLLOWING
INFORMATION

GENDER IS THE DISTINGUISHING NOUNS WITHOUT REGARD TO SEX
A VERB IS SOMETHING TO EAT
ADVERBS SHOULD ALWAYS BE USED AS ADJECTIVES AND ADJECTIVES AS ADVERBS
EVERY SENTENCE AND NAME OF GOD MUST BEGIN WITH A CATERPILLAR


CATERPILLAR IS WELL ENOUGH BUT CAPITAL LETTER WOULD HAVE BEEN
STRICTER THE FOLLOWING IS A BRAVE ATTEMPT AT A SOLUTION BUT IT FAILED
TO LIQUIFY

WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO SAY SOME PROSE OR POETRY BEFORE THEY SAY THE
POETRY OR PROSE THEY MUST PUT A SEMICOLON JUST AFTER THE INTRODUCTION
OF THE PROSE OR POETRY

THE CHAPTER ON MATHEMATICS IS FULL OF FRUIT FROM IT I TAKE A FEW
SAMPLESMAINLY IN AN UNRIPE STATE

A STRAIGHT LINE IS ANY DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO PLACES
PARALLEL LINES ARE LINES THAT CAN NEVER MEET UNTIL THEY RUN TOGETHER
A CIRCLE IS A ROUND STRAIGHT LINE WITH A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE
THINGS WHICH ARE EQUAL TO EACH OTHER ARE EQUAL TO ANYTHING ELSE
TO FIND THE NUMBER OF SQUARE FEET IN A ROOM YOU MULTIPLY THE ROOM BY
THE
NUMBER OF THE FEET THE PRODUCT IS THE RESULT


RIGHT YOU ARE IN THE MATTER OF GEOGRAPHY THIS LITTLE BOOK IS
UNSPEAKABLY RICH THE QUESTIONS DO NOT APPEAR TO HAVE APPLIED THE
MICROSCOPE TO THE SUBJECT AS DID THOSE QUOTED BY PROFESSOR RAVENSTEIN
STILL THEY PROVED PLENTY DIFFICULT ENOUGH WITHOUT THAT THESE PUPILS
DID NOT HUNT WITH A MICROSCOPE THEY HUNTED WITH A SHOTGUN THIS IS
SHOWN BY THE CRIPPLED CONDITION OF THE GAME THEY BROUGHT IN

AMERICA IS DIVIDED INTO THE PASSIFFIC SLOPE AND THE MISSISSIPPI VALEY

NORTH AMERICA IS SEPARATED BY SPAIN

AMERICA CONSISTS FROM NORTH TO SOUTH ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILES

THE UNITED STATES IS QUITE A SMALL COUNTRY COMPARED WITH SOME OTHER
COUNTRYS BUT IS ABOUT AS INDUSTRIOUS

THE CAPITAL OF THE UNITED STATES IS LONG ISLAND

THE PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS OF THE US IS EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANOES

THE ALAGINNIES ARE MOUNTAINS IN PHILADELPHIA

THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS ARE ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF PHILADELPHIA

IRELAND IS CALLED THE EMIGRANT ISLE BECAUSE IT IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND
GREEN

THE WIDTH OF THE DIFFERENT ZONES EUROPE LIES IN DEPEND UPON THE
SURROUNDING COUNTRY

THE IMPORTS OF A COUNTRY ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE PAID FOR THE EXPORTS
ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT

CLIMATE LASTS ALL THE TIME AND WEATHER ONLY A FEW DAYS

THE TWO MOST FAMOUS VOLCANOES OF EUROPE ARE SODOM AND GOMORRAH

THE CHAPTER HEADED ANALYSIS SHOWS US THAT THE PUPILS IN OUR PUBLIC
SCHOOLS ARE NOT MERELY LOADED UP WITH THOSE SHOWY FACTS ABOUT
GEOGRAPHY MATHEMATICS AND SO ON AND LEFT IN THAT INCOMPLETE STATE
NO THERES MACHINERY FOR CLARIFYING AND EXPANDING THEIR MINDS THEY
ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE POEMS AND ANALYZE THEM DIG OUT THEIR COMMON
SENSE REDUCE THEM TO STATISTICS AND REPRODUCE THEM IN A LUMINOUS
PROSE TRANSLATION WHICH SHALL TELL YOU AT A GLANCE WHAT THE POET WAS
TRYING TO GET AT ONE SAMPLE WILL DO HERE IS A STANZA FROM THE LADY
OF THE LAKE FOLLOWED BY THE PUPILS IMPRESSIVE EXPLANATION OF IT

ALONE BUT WITH UNBATED ZEAL THE HORSEMAN PLIED WITH SCOURGE AND
STEEL FOR JADED NOW AND SPENT WITH TOIL EMBOSSED WITH FOAM AND DARK
WITH SOIL WHILE EVERY GASP WITH SOBS HE DREW THE LABORING STAG
STRAINED FULL IN VIEW

THE MAN WHO RODE ON THE HORSE PERFORMED THE WHIP AND AN INSTRUMENT MADE
OF STEEL ALONE WITH STRONG ARDOR NOT DIMINISHING FOR BEING TIRED FROM
THE TIME PASSED WITH HARD LABOR OVERWORKED WITH ANGER AND IGNORANT WITH
WEARINESS WHILE EVERY BREATH FOR LABOR HE DREW WITH CRIES FULL OF
SORROW THE YOUNG DEER MADE IMPERFECT WHO WORKED HARD FILTERED IN
SIGHT

I SEE NOW THAT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT POEM BEFORE I HAVE HAD
GLIMPSES OF ITS MEANING IN MOMENTS WHEN I WAS NOT AS IGNORANT WITH
WEARINESS AS USUAL BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE WHOLE SPACIOUS IDEA
OF IT EVER FILTERED IN SIGHT IF I WERE A PUBLICSCHOOL PUPIL I WOULD
PUT THOSE OTHER STUDIES ASIDE AND STICK TO ANALYSIS FOR AFTER ALL IT
IS THE THING TO SPREAD YOUR MIND

WE COME NOW TO HISTORICAL MATTERS HISTORICAL REMAINS ONE MIGHT SAY
AS ONE TURNS THE PAGES HE IS IMPRESSED WITH THE DEPTH TO WHICH ONE DATE
HAS BEEN DRIVEN INTO THE AMERICAN CHILDS HEAD THE DATE IS THERE
AND IT IS THERE TO STAY AND IT IS ALWAYS AT HAND ALWAYS DELIVERABLE
AT A MOMENTS NOTICE BUT THE FACT THAT BELONGS WITH IT THAT IS QUITE
ANOTHER MATTER ONLY THE DATE ITSELF IS FAMILIAR AND SURE ITS VAST
FACT HAS FAILED OF LODGMENT IT WOULD APPEAR THAT WHENEVER YOU ASK A
PUBLICSCHOOL PUPIL WHEN A THINGANYTHING NO MATTER WHATHAPPENED AND
HE IS IN DOUBT HE ALWAYS RIPS OUT HIS HE APPLIES IT TO
EVERYTHING FROM THE LANDING OF THE ARK TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE
HORSECAR WELL AFTER ALL IT IS OUR FIRST DATE AND SO IT IS RIGHT
ENOUGH TO HONOR IT AND PAY THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO
HONOR IT

FOE LOCKE POPE SWIFT GOLDSMITH BURNS COWPER WORDSWORTH GIBBON
BYRON COLERIDGE HOOD SCOTT MACAULAY GEORGE ELIOT DICKENS BULWER
THACKERAY BROWNING MRS BROWNING TENNYSON AND DISRAELIA FACT WHICH
SHOWS THAT INTO THE RESTRICTED STOMACH OF THE PUBLICSCHOOL PUPIL IS
SHOVELED EVERY YEAR THE BLOOD BONE AND VISCERA OF A GIGANTIC
LITERATURE AND THE SAME IS THERE DIGESTED AND DISPOSED OF IN A MOST
SUCCESSFUL AND CHARACTERISTIC AND GRATIFYING PUBLICSCHOOL WAY I HAVE
SPACE FOR BUT A TRIFLING FEW OF THE RESULTS

TAKEN IN MODERATION

SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THESE POEMS WERE NOT WRITTEN BY HOMER BUT BY
ANOTHER MAN OF THE SAME NAME

A SORT OF SADNESS KIND OF SHONE IN BRYANTS POEMS

HOLMES IS A VERY PROFLIGATE AND AMUSING WRITER

WHEN THE PUBLICSCHOOL PUPIL WRESTLES WITH THE POLITICAL FEATURES OF
THE GREAT REPUBLIC THEY THROW HIM SOMETIMES

THE THREE DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT IS THE PRESIDENT RULES THE
WORLD THE GOVERNOR RULES THE STATE THE MAYOR RULES THE CITY

THE FIRST CONSCIENTIOUS CONGRESS MET IN PHILADELPHIA

DOMESTIC HOSTILITY

TRUTH CRUSHED TO EARTH WILL RISE AGAIN AS FOLLOWS

THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES IS THAT PART OF THE BOOK AT THE
END WHICH NOBODY READS

AND HERE SHE RISES ONCE MORE AND UNTIMELY THERE SHOULD BE A LIMIT TO
PUBLICSCHOOL INSTRUCTION IT CANNOT BE WISE OR WELL TO LET THE YOUNG
FIND OUT EVERYTHING

CONGRESS IS DIVIDED INTO CIVILIZED HALF CIVILIZED AND SAVAGE

HERE ARE SOME RESULTS OF STUDY IN MUSIC AND ORATORY

AN INTERVAL IN MUSIC IS THE DISTANCE ON THE KEYBOARD FROM ONE PIANO TO
THE NEXT

A REST MEANS YOU ARE NOT TO SING IT

EMPHASIS IS PUTTING MORE DISTRESS ON ONE WORD THAN ANOTHER

THE CHAPTER ON PHYSIOLOGY CONTAINS MUCH THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE LOST TO
SCIENCE

IN THE STOMACH STARCH IS CHANGED TO CANE SUGAR AND CANE SUGAR TO SUGAR
CANE

THE OLFACTORY NERVE ENTERS THE CAVITY OF THE ORBIT AND IS DEVELOPED
INTO THE SPECIAL SENSE OF HEARING

THE GROWTH OF A TOOTH BEGINS IN THE BACK OF THE MOUTH AND EXTENDS TO
THE STOMACH

IF WE WERE ON A RAILROAD TRACK AND A TRAIN WAS COMING THE TRAIN WOULD
DEAFEN OUR EARS SO THAT WE COULDNT SEE TO GET OFF THE TRACK

IF UP TO THIS POINT NONE OF MY QUOTATIONS HAVE ADDED FLAVOR TO THE
JOHNSONIAN ANECDOTE AT THE HEAD OF THIS ARTICLE LET US MAKE ANOTHER
ATTEMPT

THE THEORY THAT INTUITIVE TRUTHS ARE DISCOVERED BY THE LIGHT OF NATURE
ORIGINATED FROM ST JOHNS INTERPRETATION OF A PASSAGE IN THE GOSPEL OF
PLATO

THE WEIGHT OF THE EARTH IS FOUND BY COMPARING A MASS OF KNOWN LEAD WITH
THAT OF A MASS OF UNKNOWN LEAD

TO FIND THE WEIGHT OF THE EARTH TAKE THE LENGTH OF A DEGREE ON A
MERIDIAN AND MULTIPLY BY POUNDS

THE SPHERES ARE TO EACH OTHER AS THE SQUARES OF THEIR HOMOLOGOUS SIDES

A BODY WILL GO JUST AS FAR IN THE FIRST SECOND AS THE BODY WILL GO PLUS
THE FORCE OF GRAVITY AND THATS EQUAL TO TWICE WHAT THE BODY WILL GO

SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS THE WEIGHT TO BE COMPARED WEIGHT OF AN EQUAL VOLUME
OF OR THAT IS THE WEIGHT OF A BODY COMPARED WITH THE WEIGHT OF AN EQUAL
VOLUME

THE LAW OF FLUID PRESSURE DIVIDE THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF ORGANIZED
BODIES BY THE FORM OF ATTRACTION AND THE NUMBER INCREASED WILL BE THE
FORM

INERTIA IS THAT PROPERTY OF BODIES BY VIRTUE OF WHICH IT CANNOT CHANGE
ITS OWN CONDITION OF REST OR MOTION IN OTHER WORDS IT IS THE NEGATIVE
QUALITY OF PASSIVENESS EITHER IN RECOVERABLE LATENCY OR INSIPIENT
LATESCENCE

IF A LAUGH IS FAIR HERE NOT THE STRUGGLING CHILD NOR THE
UNINTELLIGENT TEACHEROR RATHER THE UNINTELLIGENT BOARDS COMMITTEES
AND TRUSTEESARE THE PROPER TARGET FOR IT ALL THROUGH THIS LITTLE BOOK
ONE DETECTS THE SIGNS OF A CERTAIN PROBABLE FACTTHAT A LARGE PART OF
THE PUPILS INSTRUCTION CONSISTS IN CRAMMING HIM WITH OBSCURE AND
WORDY RULES WHICH HE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND AND HAS NO TIME TO
UNDERSTAND IT WOULD BE AS USEFUL TO CRAM HIM WITH BRICKBATS THEY
WOULD AT LEAST STAY IN A TOWN IN THE INTERIOR OF NEW YORK A FEW YEARS
AGO A GENTLEMAN SET FORTH A MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM AND PROPOSED TO GIVE
A PRIZE TO EVERY PUBLICSCHOOL PUPIL WHO SHOULD FURNISH THE CORRECT
SOLUTION OF IT TWENTYTWO OF THE BRIGHTEST BOYS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS
ENTERED THE CONTEST THE PROBLEM WAS NOT A VERY DIFFICULT ONE FOR
PUPILS OF THEIR MATHEMATICAL RANK AND STANDING YET THEY ALL FAILEDBY
A HAIRTHROUGH ONE TRIFLING MISTAKE OR ANOTHER SOME SEARCHING
QUESTIONS WERE ASKED WHEN IT TURNED OUT THAT THESE LADS WERE AS GLIB
AS PARROTS WITH THE RULES BUT COULD NOT REASON OUT A SINGLE RULE OR
EXPLAIN THE PRINCIPLE UNDERLYING IT THEIR MEMORIES HAD BEEN STOCKED
BUT NOT THEIR UNDERSTANDINGS IT WAS A CASE OF BRICKBAT CULTURE PURE
AND SIMPLE

THERE ARE SEVERAL CURIOUS COMPOSITIONS IN THE LITTLE BOOK AND WE
MUST MAKE ROOM FOR ONE IT IS FULL OF NAVET BRUTAL TRUTH AND
UNEMBARRASSED DIRECTNESS AND IS THE FUNNIEST GENUINE BOYS
COMPOSITION I THINK I HAVE EVER SEEN

ON GIRLS


GIRLS ARE VERY STUCK UP AND DIGNEFIED IN THEIR MANER AND BE HAVE YOUR
THEY THINK MORE OF DRESS THAN ANYTHING AND LIKE TO PLAY WITH DOWLS AND
RAGS THEY CRY IF THEY SEE A COW IN A FAR DISTANCE AND ARE AFRAID OF
GUNS THEY STAY AT HOME ALL THE TIME AND GO TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY THEY
ARE ALWAYS SICK THEY ARE ALWAYS FUNY AND MAKING FUN OF BOYS HANDS
AND THEY SAY HOW DIRTY THEY CANT PLAY MARBELS I PITY THEM POOR
THINGS THEY MAKE FUN OF BOYS AND THEN TURN ROUND AND LOVE THEM I DONT
BELEAVE THEY EVER KILED A CAT OR ANYTHING THEY LOOK OUT EVERY NITE AND
SAY OH ANT THE MOON LOVELY THIR IS ONE THING I HAVE NOT TOLD AND THAT
IS THEY ALWAYS NOW THEIR LESSONS BETTERN BOYS

FROM MR EDWARD CHANNINGS RECENT ARTICLE IN SCIENCE

THE MARKED DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BOOKS NOW BEING PRODUCED BY FRENCH
ENGLISH AND AMERICAN TRAVELERS ON THE ONE HAND AND GERMAN EXPLORERS
ON THE OTHER IS TOO GREAT TO ESCAPE ATTENTION THAT DIFFERENCE IS DUE
ENTIRELY TO THE FACT THAT IN SCHOOL AND UNIVERSITY THE GERMAN IS
TAUGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE TO SEE AND IN THE SECOND PLACE TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT HE DOES SEE




A SIMPLIFIED ALPHABET


THIS ARTICLE WRITTEN DURING THE AUTUMN OF WAS ABOUT THE LAST
WRITING DONE BY MARK TWAIN ON ANY IMPERSONAL SUBJECT

I HAVE HAD A KINDLY FEELING A FRIENDLY FEELING A COUSINLY FEELING
TOWARD SIMPLIFIED SPELLING FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVEMENT THREE
YEARS AGO BUT NOTHING MORE INFLAMED THAN THAT IT SEEMED TO ME TO
MERELY PROPOSE TO SUBSTITUTE ONE INADEQUACY FOR ANOTHER A SORT OF
PATCHING AND PLUGGING POOR OLD DENTAL RELICS WITH CEMENT AND GOLD AND
PORCELAIN PASTE WHAT WAS REALLY WANTED WAS A NEW SET OF TEETH THAT IS
TO SAY A NEW ALPHABET

THE HEART OF OUR TROUBLE IS WITH OUR FOOLISH ALPHABET IT DOESNT KNOW
HOW TO SPELL AND CANT BE TAUGHT IN THIS IT IS LIKE ALL OTHER
ALPHABETS EXCEPT ONETHE PHONOGRAPHIC THAT IS THE ONLY COMPETENT
ALPHABET IN THE WORLD IT CAN SPELL AND CORRECTLY PRONOUNCE ANY WORD IN
OUR LANGUAGE

THAT ADMIRABLE ALPHABET THAT BRILLIANT ALPHABET THAT INSPIRED
ALPHABET CAN BE LEARNED IN AN HOUR OR TWO IN A WEEK THE STUDENT CAN
LEARN TO WRITE IT WITH SOME LITTLE FACILITY AND TO READ IT WITH
CONSIDERABLE EASE I KNOW FOR I SAW IT TRIED IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL IN
NEVADA FORTYFIVE YEARS AGO AND WAS SO IMPRESSED BY THE INCIDENT THAT
IT HAS REMAINED IN MY MEMORY EVER SINCE

I WISH WE COULD ADOPT IT IN PLACE OF OUR PRESENT WRITTEN AND PRINTED
CHARACTER I MEAN SIMPLY THE ALPHABET SIMPLY THE CONSONANTS AND THE
VOWELSI DONT MEAN ANY REDUCTIONS OR ABBREVIATIONS OF THEM SUCH AS
THE SHORTHAND WRITER USES IN ORDER TO GET COMPRESSION AND SPEED NO I
WOULD SPELL EVERY WORD OUT

I WILL INSERT THE ALPHABET HERE AS I FIND IT IN BURNZS PHONIC
SHORTHAND FIGURE IT IS ARRANGED ON THE BASIS OF ISAAC PITMANS
PHONOGRAPHY ISAAC PITMAN WAS THE ORIGINATOR AND FATHER OF SCIENTIFIC
PHONOGRAPHY IT IS USED THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE IT WAS A MEMORABLE
INVENTION HE MADE IT PUBLIC SEVENTYTHREE YEARS AGO THE FIRM OF ISAAC
PITMAN SONS NEW YORK STILL EXISTS AND THEY CONTINUE THE MASTERS
WORK

WHAT SHOULD WE GAIN

FIRST OF ALL WE COULD SPELL DEFINITELYAND CORRECTLYANY WORD YOU
PLEASE JUST BY THE SOUND OF IT WE CANT DO THAT WITH OUR PRESENT
ALPHABET FOR INSTANCE TAKE A SIMPLE EVERYDAY WORD PHTHISIS IF WE
TRIED TO SPELL IT BY THE SOUND OF IT WE SHOULD MAKE IT TYSIS AND BE
LAUGHED AT BY EVERY EDUCATED PERSON

SECONDLY WE SHOULD GAIN IN REDUCTION OF LABOR IN WRITING

SIMPLIFIED SPELLING MAKES VALUABLE REDUCTIONS IN THE CASE OF SEVERAL
HUNDRED WORDS BUT THE NEW SPELLING MUST BE LEARNED YOU CANT SPELL
THEM BY THE SOUND YOU MUST GET THEM OUT OF THE BOOK

BUT EVEN IF WE KNEW THE SIMPLIFIED FORM FOR EVERY WORD IN THE LANGUAGE
THE PHONOGRAPHIC ALPHABET WOULD STILL BEAT THE SIMPLIFIED SPELLER
HANDS DOWN IN THE IMPORTANT MATTER OF ECONOMY OF LABOR I WILL
ILLUSTRATE

PRESENT FORM THROUGH LAUGH HIGHLAND

SIMPLIFIED FORM THRU LAFF HYLAND

PHONOGRAPHIC FORM FIGURE

TO WRITE THE WORD THROUGH THE PEN HAS TO MAKE TWENTYONE STROKES

TO WRITE THE WORD THRU THE PEN HAS TO MAKE TWELVE STROKESA GOOD
SAVING

TO WRITE THAT SAME WORD WITH THE PHONOGRAPHIC ALPHABET THE PEN HAS TO
MAKE ONLY THREE STROKES

TO WRITE THE WORD LAUGH THE PEN HAS TO MAKE FOURTEEN STROKES

TO WRITE LAFF THE PEN HAS TO MAKE THE SAME NUMBER OF STROKESNO
LABOR IS SAVED TO THE PENMAN

TO WRITE THE SAME WORD WITH THE PHONOGRAPHIC ALPHABET THE PEN HAS TO
MAKE ONLY THREE STROKES

TO WRITE THE WORD HIGHLAND THE PEN HAS TO MAKE TWENTYTWO STROKES

TO WRITE HYLAND THE PEN HAS TO MAKE EIGHTEEN STROKES

TO WRITE THAT WORD WITH THE PHONOGRAPHIC ALPHABET THE PEN HAS TO MAKE
ONLY FIVE STROKES FIGURE

TO WRITE THE WORDS PHONOGRAPHIC ALPHABET THE PEN HAS TO MAKE
FIFTYTHREE STROKES

TO WRITE FONOGRAFIC ALFABET THE PEN HAS TO MAKE FIFTY STROKES TO
THE PENMAN THE SAVING IN LABOR IS INSIGNIFICANT

TO WRITE THAT WORD WITH VOWELS WITH THE PHONOGRAPHIC ALPHABET THE
PEN HAS TO MAKE ONLY SEVENTEEN STROKES

WITHOUT THE VOWELS ONLY THIRTEEN STROKES FIGURE THE VOWELS ARE
HARDLY NECESSARY THIS TIME

WE MAKE FIVE PENSTROKES IN WRITING AN M THUS FIGURE A STROKE
DOWN A STROKE UP A SECOND STROKE DOWN A SECOND STROKE UP A FINAL
STROKE DOWN TOTAL FIVE THE PHONOGRAPHIC ALPHABET ACCOMPLISHES THE M
WITH A SINGLE STROKEA CURVE LIKE A PARENTHESIS THAT HAS COME HOME
DRUNK AND HAS FALLEN FACE DOWN RIGHT AT THE FRONT DOOR WHERE EVERYBODY
THAT GOES ALONG WILL SEE HIM AND SAY ALAS

WHEN OUR WRITTEN M IS NOT THE END OF A WORD BUT IS OTHERWISE LOCATED
IT HAS TO BE CONNECTED WITH THE NEXT LETTER AND THAT REQUIRES ANOTHER
PENSTROKE MAKING SIX IN ALL BEFORE YOU GET RID OF THAT M BUT NEVER
MIND ABOUT THE CONNECTING STROKESLET THEM GO WITHOUT COUNTING THEM
THE TWENTYSIX LETTERS OF OUR ALPHABET CONSUMED ABOUT EIGHTY
PENSTROKES FOR THEIR CONSTRUCTIONABOUT THREE PENSTROKES PER LETTER

IT IS THREE TIMES THE NUMBER REQUIRED BY THE PHONOGRAPHIC ALPHABET
IT REQUIRES BUT ONE STROKE FOR EACH LETTER

MY WRITINGGAIT ISWELL I DONT KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT I WILL TIME
MYSELF AND SEE RESULT IT IS TWENTYFOUR WORDS PER MINUTE I DONT
MEAN COMPOSING I MEAN COPYING THERE ISNT ANY DEFINITE
COMPOSINGGAIT

VERY WELL MY COPYINGGAIT IS WORDS PER HOURSAY IF I
COULD USE THE PHONOGRAPHIC CHARACTER WITH FACILITY I COULD DO THE
IN TWENTY MINUTES I COULD DO NINE HOURS COPYING IN THREE HOURS I
COULD DO THREE YEARS COPYING IN ONE YEAR ALSO IF I HAD A TYPEWRITING
MACHINE WITH THE PHONOGRAPHIC ALPHABET ON ITOH THE MIRACLES I COULD
DO

I AM NOT PRETENDING TO WRITE THAT CHARACTER WELL I HAVE NEVER HAD A
LESSON AND I AM COPYING THE LETTERS FROM THE BOOK BUT I CAN
ACCOMPLISH MY DESIRE AT ANY RATE WHICH IS TO MAKE THE READER GET A
GOOD AND CLEAR IDEA OF THE ADVANTAGE IT WOULD BE TO US IF WE COULD
DISCARD OUR PRESENT ALPHABET AND PUT THIS BETTER ONE IN ITS PLACEUSING
IT IN BOOKS NEWSPAPERS WITH THE TYPEWRITER AND WITH THE PEN

FIGURE MAN DOG HORSE I THINK IT IS GRACEFUL AND WOULD LOOK
COMELY IN PRINT AND CONSIDERONCE MORE I BEGWHAT A LABORSAVER IT
IS TEN PENSTROKES WITH THE ONE SYSTEM TO CONVEY THOSE THREE WORDS
ABOVE AND THIRTYTHREE BY THE OTHER FIGURE I MEAN IN SOME WAYS
NOT IN ALL I SUPPOSE I MIGHT GO SO FAR AS TO SAY IN MOST WAYS AND BE
WITHIN THE FACTS BUT NEVER MIND LET IT GO AT SOME ONE OF THE WAYS
IN WHICH IT EXERCISES THIS BIRTHRIGHT ISAS I THINKCONTINUING TO USE
OUR LAUGHABLE ALPHABET THESE SEVENTYTHREE YEARS WHILE THERE WAS A
RATIONAL ONE AT HAND TO BE HAD FOR THE TAKING

IT HAS TAKEN FIVE HUNDRED YEARS TO SIMPLIFY SOME OF CHAUCERS ROTTEN
SPELLINGIF I MAY BE ALLOWED TO USE SO FRANK A TERM AS THATAND IT WILL
TAKE FIVE HUNDRED MORE TO GET OUR EXASPERATING NEW SIMPLIFIED
CORRUPTIONS ACCEPTED AND RUNNING SMOOTHLY AND WE SHANT BE ANY BETTER
OFF THEN THAN WE ARE NOW FOR IN THAT DAY WE SHALL STILL HAVE THE
PRIVILEGE THE SIMPLIFIERS ARE EXERCISING NOW ANYBODY CAN CHANGE THE
SPELLING THAT WANTS TO

BUT YOU CANT CHANGE THE PHONOGRAPHIC SPELLING THERE ISNT ANY WAY
IT WILL ALWAYS FOLLOW THE SOUND IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE SPELLING
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE SOUND FIRST

MIND I MYSELF AM A SIMPLIFIED SPELLER I BELONG TO THAT UNHAPPY GUILD
THAT IS PATIENTLY AND HOPEFULLY TRYING TO REFORM OUR DRUNKEN OLD
ALPHABET BY REDUCING HIS WHISKEY WELL IT WILL IMPROVE HIM WHEN THEY
GET THROUGH AND HAVE REFORMED HIM ALL THEY CAN BY THEIR SYSTEM HE WILL
BE ONLY HALF DRUNK ABOVE THAT CONDITION THEIR SYSTEM CAN NEVER LIFT
HIM THERE IS NO COMPETENT AND LASTING AND REAL REFORM FOR HIM BUT TO
TAKE AWAY HIS WHISKEY ENTIRELY AND FILL UP HIS JUG WITH PITMANS
WHOLESOME AND UNDISEASED ALPHABET

ONE GREAT DRAWBACK TO SIMPLIFIED SPELLING IS THAT IN PRINT A
SIMPLIFIED WORD LOOKS SO LIKE THE VERY NATION AND WHEN YOU BUNCH A
WHOLE SQUADRON OF THE SIMPLIFIED TOGETHER THE SPECTACLE IS VERY NEARLY
UNENDURABLE

THE DA MA OV KOARS KUM WHEN THE PUBLIK MA BE EXPEKTD TO GET REKONSYLED
TO THE BEZAIR ASSPEKT OF THE SIMPLIFIED KOMBYNASHUNS BUTIF I MAY BE
ALLOWED THE EXPRESSIONIS IT WORTH THE WASTED TIME FIGURE

TO SEE OUR LETTERS PUT TOGETHER IN WAYS TO WHICH WE ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED
OFFENDS THE EYE AND ALSO TAKES THE EXPRESSION OUT OF THE WORDS

LA ON MAKDUF AND DAMD BE HE HOO FURST KRYS HOLD ENUF

IT DOESNT THRILL YOU AS IT USED TO DO THE SIMPLIFICATIONS HAVE SUCKED
THE THRILL ALL OUT OF IT

BUT A WRITTEN CHARACTER WITH WHICH WE ARE NOT ACQUAINTED DOES NOT
OFFEND USGREEK HEBREW RUSSIAN ARABIC AND THE OTHERSTHEY HAVE AN
INTERESTING LOOK AND WE SEE BEAUTY IN THEM TOO AND THIS IS TRUE OF
HIEROGLYPHICS AS WELL THERE IS SOMETHING PLEASANT AND ENGAGING ABOUT
THE MATHEMATICAL SIGNS WHEN WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEM THE MYSTERY
HIDDEN IN THESE THINGS HAS A FASCINATION FOR US WE CANT COME ACROSS A
PRINTED PAGE OF SHORTHAND WITHOUT BEING IMPRESSED BY IT AND WISHING WE
COULD READ IT

VERY WELL WHAT I AM OFFERING FOR ACCEPTANCE AND ADOPTION IS NOT
SHORTHAND BUT LONGHAND WRITTEN WITH THE SHORTHAND ALPHABET
UNREDUCED YOU CAN WRITE THREE TIMES AS MANY WORDS IN A MINUTE WITH IT
AS YOU CAN WRITE WITH OUR ALPHABET AND SO IN A WAY IT IS PROPERLY
A SHORTHAND IT HAS A PLEASANT LOOK TOO A BEGUILING LOOK AN INVITING
LOOK I WILL WRITE SOMETHING IN IT IN MY RUDE AND UNTAUGHT WAY
FIGURE

EVEN WHEN I DO IT IT COMES OUT PRETTIER THAN IT DOES IN SIMPLIFIED
SPELLING YES AND IN THE SIMPLIFIED IT COSTS ONE HUNDRED AND
TWENTYTHREE PENSTROKES TO WRITE IT WHEREAS IN THE PHONOGRAPHIC IT
COSTS ONLY TWENTYNINE

FIGURE IS PROBABLY FIGURE

LET US HOPE SO ANYWAY




AS CONCERNS INTERPRETING THE DEITY


I

THIS LINE OF HIEROGLYPHS WAS FOR FOURTEEN YEARS THE DESPAIR OF ALL THE
SCHOLARS WHO LABORED OVER THE MYSTERIES OF THE ROSETTA STONE FIGURE


AFTER FIVE YEARS OF STUDY CHAMPOLLION TRANSLATED IT THUS

THEREFORE LET THE WORSHIP OF EPIPHANES BE MAINTAINED IN ALL THE
TEMPLES THIS UPON PAIN OF DEATH

THAT WAS THE TWENTYFOURTH TRANSLATION THAT HAD BEEN FURNISHED BY
SCHOLARS FOR A TIME IT STOOD BUT ONLY FOR A TIME THEN DOUBTS BEGAN
TO ASSAIL IT AND UNDERMINE IT AND THE SCHOLARS RESUMED THEIR LABORS
THREE YEARS OF PATIENT WORK PRODUCED ELEVEN NEW TRANSLATIONS AMONG
THEM THIS BY GRUNFELDT WAS RECEIVED WITH CONSIDERABLE FAVOR

THE HORSE OF EPIPHANES SHALL BE MAINTAINED AT THE PUBLIC EXPENSE THIS
UPON PAIN OF DEATH

BUT THE FOLLOWING RENDERING BY GOSPODIN WAS RECEIVED BY THE LEARNED
WORLD WITH YET GREATER FAVOR

THE PRIEST SHALL EXPLAIN THE WISDOM OF EPIPHANES TO ALL THESE PEOPLE
AND THESE SHALL LISTEN WITH REVERENCE UPON PAIN OF DEATH

SEVEN YEARS FOLLOWED IN WHICH TWENTYONE FRESH AND WIDELY VARYING
RENDERINGS WERE SCOREDNONE OF THEM QUITE CONVINCING BUT NOW AT LAST
CAME RAWLINSON THE YOUNGEST OF ALL THE SCHOLARS WITH A TRANSLATION
WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY AND UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED AS BEING THE CORRECT
VERSION AND HIS NAME BECAME FAMOUS IN A DAY SO FAMOUS INDEED THAT
EVEN THE CHILDREN WERE FAMILIAR WITH IT AND SUCH A NOISE DID THE
ACHIEVEMENT ITSELF MAKE THAT NOT EVEN THE NOISE OF THE MONUMENTAL
POLITICAL EVENT OF THAT SAME YEARTHE FLIGHT FROM ELBAWAS ABLE TO
SMOTHER IT TO SILENCE RAWLINSONS VERSION READS AS FOLLOWS

THEREFORE WALK NOT AWAY FROM THE WISDOM OF EPIPHANES BUT TURN AND
FOLLOW IT SO SHALL IT CONDUCT THEE TO THE TEMPLES PEACE AND SOFTEN
FOR THEE THE SORROWS OF LIFE AND THE PAINS OF DEATH

HERE IS ANOTHER DIFFICULT TEXT FIGURE

IT IS DEMOTICA STYLE OF EGYPTIAN WRITING AND A PHASE OF THE LANGUAGE
WHICH HAD PERISHED FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF ALL MEN TWENTYFIVE HUNDRED
YEARS BEFORE THE CHRISTIAN ERA

OUR RED INDIANS HAVE LEFT MANY RECORDS IN THE FORM OF PICTURES UPON
OUR CRAGS AND BOULDERS IT HAS TAKEN OUR MOST GIFTED AND PAINSTAKING
STUDENTS TWO CENTURIES TO GET AT THE MEANINGS HIDDEN IN THESE PICTURES
YET THERE ARE STILL TWO LITTLE LINES OF HIEROGLYPHICS AMONG THE FIGURES
GROUPED UPON THE DIGHTON ROCKS WHICH THEY HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN
INTERPRETING TO THEIR SATISFACTION THESE FIGURE

THE SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS OF THIS RIDDLE ARE PRACTICALLY INNUMERABLE
THEY WOULD FILL A BOOK

THUS WE HAVE INFINITE TROUBLE IN SOLVING MANMADE MYSTERIES IT IS ONLY
WHEN WE SET OUT TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF GOD THAT OUR DIFFICULTIES
DISAPPEAR IT WAS ALWAYS SO IN ANTIQUE ROMAN TIMES IT WAS THE CUSTOM
OF THE DEITY TO TRY TO CONCEAL HIS INTENTIONS IN THE ENTRAILS OF BIRDS
AND THIS WAS PATIENTLY AND HOPEFULLY CONTINUED CENTURY AFTER CENTURY
ALTHOUGH THE ATTEMPTED CONCEALMENT NEVER SUCCEEDED IN A SINGLE
RECORDED INSTANCE THE AUGURS COULD READ ENTRAILS AS EASILY AS A MODERN
CHILD CAN READ COARSE PRINT ROMAN HISTORY IS FULL OF THE MARVELS OF
INTERPRETATION WHICH THESE EXTRAORDINARY MEN PERFORMED THESE STRANGE
AND WONDERFUL ACHIEVEMENTS MOVE OUR AWE AND COMPEL OUR ADMIRATION
THOSE MEN COULD PIERCE TO THE MARROW OF A MYSTERY INSTANTLY IF THE
ROSETTASTONE IDEA HAD BEEN INTRODUCED IT WOULD HAVE DEFEATED THEM BUT
ENTRAILS HAD NO EMBARRASSMENTS FOR THEM ENTRAILS HAVE GONE OUT
NOWENTRAILS AND DREAMS IT WAS AT LAST FOUND OUT THAT AS HIDINGPLACES
FOR THE DIVINE INTENTIONS THEY WERE INADEQUATE

A PART OF THE WALL OF VALLETRI HAVING IN FORMER TIMES BEEN STRUCK WITH
THUNDER THE RESPONSE OF THE SOOTHSAYERS WAS THAT A NATIVE OF THAT
TOWN WOULD SOME TIME OR OTHER ARRIVE AT SUPREME POWER BOHNS
SUETONIUS P

SOME TIME OR OTHER IT LOOKS INDEFINITE BUT NO MATTER IT HAPPENED
ALL THE SAME ONE NEEDED ONLY TO WAIT AND BE PATIENT AND KEEP WATCH
THEN HE WOULD FIND OUT THAT THE THUNDERSTROKE HAD CAESAR AUGUSTUS IN
MIND AND HAD COME TO GIVE NOTICE

THERE WERE OTHER ADVANCEADVERTISEMENTS ONE OF THEM APPEARED JUST
BEFORE CAESAR AUGUSTUS WAS BORN AND WAS MOST POETIC AND TOUCHING AND
ROMANTIC IN ITS FEELINGS AND ASPECTS IT WAS A DREAM IT WAS DREAMED BY
CAESAR AUGUSTUSS MOTHER AND INTERPRETED AT THE USUAL RATES

ATIA BEFORE HER DELIVERY DREAMED THAT HER BOWELS STRETCHED TO THE
STARS AND EXPANDED THROUGH THE WHOLE CIRCUIT OF HEAVEN AND
EARTHSUETONIUS P

THAT WAS IN THE AUGURS LINE AND FURNISHED HIM NO DIFFICULTIES BUT IT
WOULD HAVE TAKEN RAWLINSON AND CHAMPOLLION FOURTEEN YEARS TO MAKE SURE
OF WHAT IT MEANT BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SURPRISED AND DIZZY IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO LATE TO BE VALUABLE THEN AND THE BILL FOR SERVICE
WOULD HAVE BEEN BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATION

IN THOSE OLD ROMAN DAYS A GENTLEMANS EDUCATION WAS NOT COMPLETE UNTIL
HE HAD TAKEN A THEOLOGICAL COURSE AT THE SEMINARY AND LEARNED HOW TO
TRANSLATE ENTRAILS CAESAR AUGUSTUSS EDUCATION RECEIVED THIS FINAL
POLISH ALL THROUGH HIS LIFE WHENEVER HE HAD POULTRY ON THE MENU HE
SAVED THE INTERIORS AND KEPT HIMSELF INFORMED OF THE DEITYS PLANS BY
EXERCISING UPON THOSE INTERIORS THE ARTS OF AUGURY

IN HIS FIRST CONSULSHIP WHILE HE WAS OBSERVING THE AUGURIES TWELVE
VULTURES PRESENTED THEMSELVES AS THEY HAD DONE TO ROMULUS AND WHEN HE
OFFERED SACRIFICE THE LIVERS OF ALL THE VICTIMS WERE FOLDED INWARD IN
THE LOWER PART A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH WAS REGARDED BY THOSE PRESENT WHO
HAD SKILL IN THINGS OF THAT NATURE AS AN INDUBITABLE PROGNOSTIC OF
GREAT AND WONDERFUL FORTUNESUETONIUS P

INDUBITABLE IS A STRONG WORD BUT NO DOUBT IT WAS JUSTIFIED IF THE
LIVERS WERE REALLY TURNED THAT WAY IN THOSE DAYS CHICKEN LIVERS WERE
STRANGELY AND DELICATELY SENSITIVE TO COMING EVENTS NO MATTER HOW FAR
OFF THEY MIGHT BE AND THEY COULD NEVER KEEP STILL BUT WOULD CURL AND
SQUIRM LIKE THAT PARTICULARLY WHEN VULTURES CAME AND SHOWED INTEREST
IN THAT APPROACHING GREAT EVENT AND IN BREAKFAST

II

WE MAY NOW SKIP ELEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS WHICH BRINGS
US DOWN TO ENLIGHTENED CHRISTIAN TIMES AND THE TROUBLED DAYS OF KING
STEPHEN OF ENGLAND THE AUGUR HAS HAD HIS DAY AND HAS BEEN LONG AGO
FORGOTTEN THE PRIEST HAD FALLEN HEIR TO HIS TRADE

KING HENRY IS DEAD STEPHEN THAT BOLD AND OUTRAGEOUS PERSON COMES
FLYING OVER FROM NORMANDY TO STEAL THE THRONE FROM HENRYS DAUGHTER HE
ACCOMPLISHED HIS CRIME AND HENRY OF HUNTINGTON A PRIEST OF HIGH
DEGREE MOURNS OVER IT IN HIS CHRONICLE THE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
CONSECRATED STEPHEN WHEREFORE THE LORD VISITED THE ARCHBISHOP WITH
THE SAME JUDGMENT WHICH HE HAD INFLICTED UPON HIM WHO STRUCK JEREMIAH
THE GREAT PRIEST HE DIED WITHIN A YEAR

STEPHENS WAS THE GREATER OFFENSE BUT STEPHEN COULD WAIT NOT SO THE
ARCHBISHOP APPARENTLY

THE KINGDOM WAS A PREY TO INTESTINE WARS SLAUGHTER FIRE AND RAPINE
SPREAD RUIN THROUGHOUT THE LAND CRIES OF DISTRESS HORROR AND WOE
ROSE IN EVERY QUARTER

THAT WAS THE RESULT OF STEPHENS CRIME THESE UNSPEAKABLE CONDITIONS
CONTINUED DURING NINETEEN YEARS THEN STEPHEN DIED AS COMFORTABLY AS
ANY MAN EVER DID AND WAS HONORABLY BURIED IT MAKES ONE PITY THE POOR
ARCHBISHOP AND WISH THAT HE TOO COULD HAVE BEEN LET OFF AS
LENIENTLY HOW DID HENRY OF HUNTINGTON KNOW THAT THE ARCHBISHOP WAS
SENT TO HIS GRAVE BY JUDGMENT OF GOD FOR CONSECRATING STEPHEN HE DOES
NOT EXPLAIN NEITHER DOES HE EXPLAIN WHY STEPHEN WAS AWARDED A
PLEASANTER DEATH THAN HE WAS ENTITLED TO WHILE THE AGED KING HENRY
HIS PREDECESSOR WHO HAD RULED ENGLAND THIRTYFIVE YEARS TO THE
PEOPLES STRONGLY WORDED SATISFACTION WAS CONDEMNED TO CLOSE HIS LIFE
IN CIRCUMSTANCES MOST DISTINCTLY UNPLEASANT INCONVENIENT AND
DISAGREEABLE HIS WAS PROBABLY THE MOST UNINSPIRING FUNERAL THAT IS SET
DOWN IN HISTORY THERE IS NOT A DETAIL ABOUT IT THAT IS ATTRACTIVE IT
SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN JUST THE FUNERAL FOR STEPHEN AND EVEN AT THIS
FARDISTANT DAY IT IS MATTER OF JUST REGRET THAT BY AN INDISCRETION THE
WRONG MAN GOT IT

WHENEVER GOD PUNISHES A MAN HENRY OF HUNTINGTON KNOWS WHY IT WAS DONE
AND TELLS US AND HIS PEN IS ELOQUENT WITH ADMIRATION BUT WHEN A MAN
HAS EARNED PUNISHMENT AND ESCAPES HE DOES NOT EXPLAIN HE IS
EVIDENTLY PUZZLED BUT HE DOES NOT SAY ANYTHING I THINK IT IS OFTEN
APPARENT THAT HE IS PAINED BY THESE DISCREPANCIES BUT LOYALLY TRIES
HIS BEST NOT TO SHOW IT WHEN HE CANNOT PRAISE HE DELIVERS HIMSELF OF
A SILENCE SO MARKED THAT A SUSPICIOUS PERSON COULD MISTAKE IT FOR
SUPPRESSED CRITICISM HOWEVER HE HAS PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES TO FEEL
CONTENTED WITH THE WAY THINGS GOHIS BOOK IS FULL OF THEM

KING DAVID OF SCOTLAND UNDER COLOR OF RELIGION CAUSED HIS FOLLOWERS
TO DEAL MOST BARBAROUSLY WITH THE ENGLISH THEY RIPPED OPEN WOMEN
TOSSED CHILDREN ON THE POINTS OF SPEARS BUTCHERED PRIESTS AT THE
ALTARS AND CUTTING OFF THE HEADS FROM THE IMAGES ON CRUCIFIXES
PLACED THEM ON THE BODIES OF THE SLAIN WHILE IN EXCHANGE THEY FIXED ON
THE CRUCIFIXES THE HEADS OF THEIR VICTIMS WHEREVER THE SCOTS CAME
THERE WAS THE SAME SCENE OF HORROR AND CRUELTY WOMEN SHRIEKING OLD
MEN LAMENTING AMID THE GROANS OF THE DYING AND THE DESPAIR OF THE
LIVING


BUT THE ENGLISH GOT THE VICTORY

THEN THE CHIEF OF THE MEN OF LOTHIAN FELL PIERCED BY AN ARROW AND ALL
HIS FOLLOWERS WERE PUT TO FLIGHT FOR THE ALMIGHTY WAS OFFENDED AT THEM
AND THEIR STRENGTH WAS RENT LIKE A COBWEB


OFFENDED AT THEM FOR WHAT FOR COMMITTING THOSE FEARFUL BUTCHERIES NO
FOR THAT WAS THE COMMON CUSTOM ON BOTH SIDES AND NOT OPEN TO
CRITICISM THEN WAS IT FOR DOING THE BUTCHERIES UNDER COVER OF
RELIGION NO THAT WAS NOT IT RELIGIOUS FEELING WAS OFTEN EXPRESSED
IN THAT FERVENT WAY ALL THROUGH THOSE OLD CENTURIES THE TRUTH IS HE
WAS NOT OFFENDED AT THEM AT ALL HE WAS ONLY OFFENDED AT THEIR KING
WHO HAD BEEN FALSE TO AN OATH THEN WHY DID NOT HE PUT THE PUNISHMENT
UPON THE KING INSTEAD OF UPON THEM IT IS A DIFFICULT QUESTION ONE
CAN SEE BY THE CHRONICLE THAT THE JUDGMENTS FELL RATHER CUSTOMARILY
UPON THE WRONG PERSON BUT HENRY OF HUNTINGTON DOES NOT EXPLAIN WHY
HERE IS ONE THAT WENT TRUE THE CHRONICLERS SATISFACTION IN IT IS NOT
HIDDEN

IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST PROVIDENCE DISPLAYED ITS JUSTICE IN A
REMARKABLE MANNER FOR TWO OF THE NOBLES WHO HAD CONVERTED MONASTERIES
INTO FORTIFICATIONS EXPELLING THE MONKS THEIR SIN BEING THE SAME MET
WITH A SIMILAR PUNISHMENT ROBERT MARMION WAS ONE GODFREY DE
MANDEVILLE THE OTHER ROBERT MARMION ISSUING FORTH AGAINST THE ENEMY
WAS SLAIN UNDER THE WALLS OF THE MONASTERY BEING THE ONLY ONE WHO
FELL THOUGH HE WAS SURROUNDED BY HIS TROOPS DYING EXCOMMUNICATED HE
BECAME SUBJECT TO DEATH EVERLASTING IN LIKE MANNER EARL GODFREY WAS
SINGLED OUT AMONG HIS FOLLOWERS AND SHOT WITH AN ARROW BY A COMMON
FOOTSOLDIER HE MADE LIGHT OF THE WOUND BUT HE DIED OF IT IN A FEW
DAYS UNDER EXCOMMUNICATION SEE HERE THE LIKE JUDGMENT OF GOD
MEMORABLE THROUGH ALL AGES


THIS EXALTATION JARS UPON ME NOT BECAUSE OF THE DEATH OF THE MEN FOR
THEY DESERVED THAT BUT BECAUSE IT IS DEATH ETERNAL IN WHITEHOT FIRE
AND FLAME IT MAKES MY FLESH CRAWL I HAVE NOT KNOWN MORE THAN THREE
MEN OR PERHAPS FOUR IN MY WHOLE LIFETIME WHOM I WOULD REJOICE TO SEE
WRITHING IN THOSE FIRES FOR EVEN A YEAR LET ALONE FOREVER I BELIEVE I
WOULD RELENT BEFORE THE YEAR WAS UP AND GET THEM OUT IF I COULD I
THINK THAT IN THE LONG RUN IF A MANS WIFE AND BABIES WHO HAD NOT
HARMED ME SHOULD COME CRYING AND PLEADING I COULDNT STAND IT I KNOW
I SHOULD FORGIVE HIM AND LET HIM GO EVEN IF HE HAD VIOLATED A
MONASTERY HENRY OF HUNTINGTON HAS BEEN WATCHING GODFREY AND MARMION
FOR NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS NOW BUT I COULDNT DO IT I
KNOW I COULDNT I AM SOFT AND GENTLE IN MY NATURE AND I SHOULD HAVE
FORGIVEN THEM SEVENTYANDSEVEN TIMES LONG AGO AND I THINK GOD HAS
BUT THIS IS ONLY AN OPINION AND NOT AUTHORITATIVE LIKE HENRY OF
HUNTINGTONS INTERPRETATIONS I COULD LEARN TO INTERPRET BUT I HAVE
NEVER TRIED I GET SO LITTLE TIME

ALL THROUGH HIS BOOK HENRY EXHIBITS HIS FAMILIARITY WITH THE INTENTIONS
OF GOD AND WITH THE REASONS FOR HIS INTENTIONS SOMETIMESVERY OFTEN
IN FACTTHE ACT FOLLOWS THE INTENTION AFTER SUCH A WIDE INTERVAL OF
TIME THAT ONE WONDERS HOW HENRY COULD FIT ONE ACT OUT OF A HUNDRED TO
ONE INTENTION OUT OF A HUNDRED AND GET THE THING RIGHT EVERY TIME WHEN
THERE WAS SUCH ABUNDANT CHOICE AMONG ACTS AND INTENTIONS SOMETIMES A
MAN OFFENDS THE DEITY WITH A CRIME AND IS PUNISHED FOR IT THIRTY YEARS
LATER MEANTIME HE HAS COMMITTED A MILLION OTHER CRIMES NO MATTER
HENRY CAN PICK OUT THE ONE THAT BROUGHT THE WORMS WORMS WERE GENERALLY
USED IN THOSE DAYS FOR THE SLAYING OF PARTICULARLY WICKED PEOPLE THIS
HAS GONE OUT NOW BUT IN OLD TIMES IT WAS A FAVORITE IT ALWAYS
INDICATED A CASE OF WRATH FOR INSTANCE

THE JUST GOD AVENGING ROBERT FITZHILDERBRANDS PERFIDY A WORM GREW
IN HIS VITALS WHICH GRADUALLY GNAWING ITS WAY THROUGH HIS INTESTINES
FATTENED ON THE ABANDONED MAN TILL TORTURED WITH EXCRUCIATING
SUFFERINGS AND VENTING HIMSELF IN BITTER MOANS HE WAS BY A FITTING
PUNISHMENT BROUGHT TO HIS ENDP

IT WAS PROBABLY AN ALLIGATOR BUT WE CANNOT TELL WE ONLY KNOW IT WAS A
PARTICULAR BREED AND ONLY USED TO CONVEY WRATH SOME AUTHORITIES THINK
IT WAS AN ICHTHYOSAURUS BUT THERE IS MUCH DOUBT

HOWEVER ONE THING WE DO KNOW AND THAT IS THAT THAT WORM HAD BEEN DUE
YEARS AND YEARS ROBERT F HAD VIOLATED A MONASTERY ONCE HE HAD
COMMITTED UNPRINTABLE CRIMES SINCE AND THEY HAD BEEN PERMITTEDUNDER
DISAPPROVALBUT THE RAVISHMENT OF THE MONASTERY HAD NOT BEEN FORGOTTEN
NOR FORGIVEN AND THE WORM CAME AT LAST

WHY WERE THESE REFORMS PUT OFF IN THIS STRANGE WAY WHAT WAS TO BE
GAINED BY IT DID HENRY OF HUNTINGTON REALLY KNOW HIS FACTS OR WAS HE
ONLY GUESSING SOMETIMES I AM HALF PERSUADED THAT HE IS ONLY A GUESSER
AND NOT A GOOD ONE THE DIVINE WISDOM MUST SURELY BE OF THE BETTER
QUALITY THAN HE MAKES IT OUT TO BE

FIVE HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE HENRYS TIME SOME FORECASTS OF THE LORDS
PURPOSES WERE FURNISHED BY A POPE WHO PERCEIVED BY CERTAIN PERFECTLY
TRUSTWORTHY SIGNS FURNISHED BY THE DEITY FOR THE INFORMATION OF HIS
FAMILIARS THAT THE END OF THE WORLD WAS

ABOUT TO COME BUT AS THIS END OF THE WORLD DRAWS NEAR MANY THINGS
ARE AT HAND WHICH HAVE NOT BEFORE HAPPENED AS CHANGES IN THE AIR
TERRIBLE SIGNS IN THE HEAVENS TEMPESTS OUT OF THE COMMON ORDER OF THE
SEASONS WARS FAMINES PESTILENCES EARTHQUAKES IN VARIOUS PLACES ALL
WHICH WILL NOT HAPPEN IN OUR DAYS BUT AFTER OUR DAYS ALL WILL COME TO
PASS

STILL THE END WAS SO NEAR THAT THESE SIGNS WERE SENT BEFORE THAT WE
MAY BE CAREFUL FOR OUR SOULS AND BE FOUND PREPARED TO MEET THE
IMPENDING JUDGMENT

THAT WAS THIRTEEN HUNDRED YEARS AGO THIS IS REALLY NO IMPROVEMENT ON
THE WORK OF THE ROMAN AUGURS




CONCERNING TOBACCO


WRITTEN ABOUT NOT BEFORE PUBLISHED

AS CONCERNS TOBACCO THERE ARE MANY SUPERSTITIONS AND THE CHIEFEST IS
THISTHAT THERE IS A STANDARD GOVERNING THE MATTER WHEREAS THERE IS
NOTHING OF THE KIND EACH MANS OWN PREFERENCE IS THE ONLY STANDARD FOR
HIM THE ONLY ONE WHICH HE CAN ACCEPT THE ONLY ONE WHICH CAN COMMAND
HIM A CONGRESS OF ALL THE TOBACCOLOVERS IN THE WORLD COULD NOT ELECT
A STANDARD WHICH WOULD BE BINDING UPON YOU OR ME OR WOULD EVEN MUCH
INFLUENCE US

THE NEXT SUPERSTITION IS THAT A MAN HAS A STANDARD OF HIS OWN HE
HASNT HE THINKS HE HAS BUT HE HASNT HE THINKS HE CAN TELL WHAT HE
REGARDS AS A GOOD CIGAR FROM WHAT HE REGARDS AS A BAD ONEBUT HE CANT
HE GOES BY THE BRAND YET IMAGINES HE GOES BY THE FLAVOR ONE MAY PALM
OFF THE WORST COUNTERFEIT UPON HIM IF IT BEARS HIS BRAND HE WILL SMOKE
IT CONTENTEDLY AND NEVER SUSPECT

CHILDREN OF TWENTYFIVE WHO HAVE SEVEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE TRY TO
TELL ME WHAT IS A GOOD CIGAR AND WHAT ISNT ME WHO NEVER LEARNED TO
SMOKE BUT ALWAYS SMOKED ME WHO CAME INTO THE WORLD ASKING FOR A
LIGHT

NO ONE CAN TELL ME WHAT IS A GOOD CIGARFOR ME I AM THE ONLY JUDGE
PEOPLE WHO CLAIM TO KNOW SAY THAT I SMOKE THE WORST CIGARS IN THE
WORLD THEY BRING THEIR OWN CIGARS WHEN THEY COME TO MY HOUSE THEY
BETRAY AN UNMANLY TERROR WHEN I OFFER THEM A CIGAR THEY TELL LIES AND
HURRY AWAY TO MEET ENGAGEMENTS WHICH THEY HAVE NOT MADE WHEN THEY ARE
THREATENED WITH THE HOSPITALITIES OF MY BOX NOW THEN OBSERVE WHAT
SUPERSTITION ASSISTED BY A MANS REPUTATION CAN DO I WAS TO HAVE
TWELVE PERSONAL FRIENDS TO SUPPER ONE NIGHT ONE OF THEM WAS AS
NOTORIOUS FOR COSTLY AND ELEGANT CIGARS AS I WAS FOR CHEAP AND DEVILISH
ONES I CALLED AT HIS HOUSE AND WHEN NO ONE WAS LOOKING BORROWED A
DOUBLE HANDFUL OF HIS VERY CHOICEST CIGARS WHICH COST HIM FORTY CENTS
APIECE AND BORE REDANDGOLD LABELS IN SIGN OF THEIR NOBILITY I
REMOVED THE LABELS AND PUT THE CIGARS INTO A BOX WITH MY FAVORITE BRAND
ON ITA BRAND WHICH THOSE PEOPLE ALL KNEW AND WHICH COWED THEM AS MEN
ARE COWED BY AN EPIDEMIC THEY TOOK THESE CIGARS WHEN OFFERED AT THE
END OF THE SUPPER AND LIT THEM AND STERNLY STRUGGLED WITH THEMIN
DREARY SILENCE FOR HILARITY DIED WHEN THE FELL BRAND CAME INTO VIEW
AND STARTED AROUNDBUT THEIR FORTITUDE HELD FOR A SHORT TIME ONLY THEN
THEY MADE EXCUSES AND FILED OUT TREADING ON ONE ANOTHERS HEELS WITH
INDECENT EAGERNESS AND IN THE MORNING WHEN I WENT OUT TO OBSERVE
RESULTS THE CIGARS LAY ALL BETWEEN THE FRONT DOOR AND THE GATE ALL
EXCEPT ONETHAT ONE LAY IN THE PLATE OF THE MAN FROM WHOM I HAD
CABBAGED THE LOT ONE OR TWO WHIFFS WAS ALL HE COULD STAND HE TOLD ME
AFTERWARD THAT SOME DAY I WOULD GET SHOT FOR GIVING PEOPLE THAT KIND OF
CIGARS TO SMOKE

AM I CERTAIN OF MY OWN STANDARD PERFECTLY YES ABSOLUTELYUNLESS
SOMEBODY FOOLS ME BY PUTTING MY BRAND ON SOME OTHER KIND OF CIGAR FOR
NO DOUBT I AM LIKE THE REST AND KNOW MY CIGAR BY THE BRAND INSTEAD OF
BY THE FLAVOR HOWEVER MY STANDARD IS A PRETTY WIDE ONE AND COVERS A
GOOD DEAL OF TERRITORY TO ME ALMOST ANY CIGAR IS GOOD THAT NOBODY
ELSE WILL SMOKE AND TO ME ALMOST ALL CIGARS ARE BAD THAT OTHER PEOPLE
CONSIDER GOOD NEARLY ANY CIGAR WILL DO ME EXCEPT A HAVANA PEOPLE
THINK THEY HURT MY FEELINGS WHEN THEY COME TO MY HOUSE WITH THEIR LIFE
PRESERVERS ONI MEAN WITH THEIR OWN CIGARS IN THEIR POCKETS IT IS AN
ERROR I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF IN A SIMILAR WAY WHEN I GO INTO
DANGERTHAT IS INTO RICH PEOPLES HOUSES WHERE IN THE NATURE OF
THINGS THEY WILL HAVE HIGHTARIFF CIGARS REDANDGILT GIRDED AND
NESTED IN A ROSEWOOD BOX ALONG WITH A DAMP SPONGE CIGARS WHICH DEVELOP
A DISMAL BLACK ASH AND BURN DOWN THE SIDE AND SMELL AND WILL GROW HOT
TO THE FINGERS AND WILL GO ON GROWING HOTTER AND HOTTER AND GO ON
SMELLING MORE AND MORE INFAMOUSLY AND UNENDURABLY THE DEEPER THE FIRE
TUNNELS DOWN INSIDE BELOW THE THIMBLEFUL OF HONEST TOBACCO THAT IS IN
THE FRONT END THE FURNISHER OF IT PRAISING IT ALL THE TIME AND TELLING
YOU HOW MUCH THE DEADLY THING COSTYES WHEN I GO INTO THAT SORT OF
PERIL I CARRY MY OWN DEFENSE ALONG I CARRY MY OWN BRANDTWENTYSEVEN
CENTS A BARRELAND I LIVE TO SEE MY FAMILY AGAIN I MAY SEEM TO LIGHT
HIS REDGARTERED CIGAR BUT THAT IS ONLY FOR COURTESYS SAKE I SMUGGLE
IT INTO MY POCKET FOR THE POOR OF WHOM I KNOW MANY AND LIGHT ONE OF
MY OWN AND WHILE HE PRAISES IT I JOIN IN BUT WHEN HE SAYS IT COST
FORTYFIVE CENTS I SAY NOTHING FOR I KNOW BETTER

HOWEVER TO SAY TRUE MY TASTES ARE SO CATHOLIC THAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN
ANY CIGARS THAT I REALLY COULD NOT SMOKE EXCEPT THOSE THAT COST A
DOLLAR APIECE I HAVE EXAMINED THOSE AND KNOW THAT THEY ARE MADE OF
DOGHAIR AND NOT GOOD DOGHAIR AT THAT

I HAVE A THOROUGHLY SATISFACTORY TIME IN EUROPE FOR ALL OVER THE
CONTINENT ONE FINDS CIGARS WHICH NOT EVEN THE MOST HARDENED NEWSBOYS IN
NEW YORK WOULD SMOKE I BROUGHT CIGARS WITH ME THE LAST TIME I WILL
NOT DO THAT ANY MORE IN ITALY AS IN FRANCE THE GOVERNMENT IS THE
ONLY CIGARPEDDLER ITALY HAS THREE OR FOUR DOMESTIC BRANDS THE
MINGHETTI THE TRABUCO THE VIRGINIA AND A VERY COARSE ONE WHICH IS A
MODIFICATION OF THE VIRGINIA THE MINGHETTIS ARE LARGE AND COMELY AND
COST THREE DOLLARS AND SIXTY CENTS A HUNDRED I CAN SMOKE A HUNDRED IN
SEVEN DAYS AND ENJOY EVERY ONE OF THEM THE TRABUCOS SUIT ME TOO I
DONT REMEMBER THE PRICE BUT ONE HAS TO LEARN TO LIKE THE VIRGINIA
NOBODY IS BORN FRIENDLY TO IT IT LOOKS LIKE A RATTAIL FILE BUT
SMOKES BETTER SOME THINK IT HAS A STRAW THROUGH IT YOU PULL THIS
OUT AND IT LEAVES A FLUE OTHERWISE THERE WOULD BE NO DRAUGHT NOT
EVEN AS MUCH AS THERE IS TO A NAIL SOME PREFER A NAIL AT FIRST
HOWEVER I LIKE ALL THE FRENCH SWISS GERMAN AND ITALIAN DOMESTIC
CIGARS AND HAVE NEVER CARED TO INQUIRE WHAT THEY ARE MADE OF AND
NOBODY WOULD KNOW ANYHOW PERHAPS THERE IS EVEN A BRAND OF EUROPEAN
SMOKINGTOBACCO THAT I LIKE IT IS A BRAND USED BY THE ITALIAN
PEASANTS IT IS LOOSE AND DRY AND BLACK AND LOOKS LIKE TEAGROUNDS
WHEN THE FIRE IS APPLIED IT EXPANDS AND CLIMBS UP AND TOWERS ABOVE THE
PIPE AND PRESENTLY TUMBLES OFF INSIDE OF ONES VEST THE TOBACCO
ITSELF IS CHEAP BUT IT RAISES THE INSURANCE IT IS AS I REMARKED IN
THE BEGINNINGTHE TASTE FOR TOBACCO IS A MATTER OF SUPERSTITION THERE
ARE NO STANDARDSNO REAL STANDARDS EACH MANS PREFERENCE IS THE ONLY
STANDARD FOR HIM THE ONLY ONE WHICH HE CAN ACCEPT THE ONLY ONE WHICH
CAN COMMAND HIM




THE BEE


IT WAS MAETERLINCK WHO INTRODUCED ME TO THE BEE I MEAN IN THE
PSYCHICAL AND IN THE POETICAL WAY I HAD HAD A BUSINESS INTRODUCTION
EARLIER IT WAS WHEN I WAS A BOY IT IS STRANGE THAT I SHOULD REMEMBER
A FORMALITY LIKE THAT SO LONG IT MUST BE NEARLY SIXTY YEARS

BEE SCIENTISTS ALWAYS SPEAK OF THE BEE AS SHE IT IS BECAUSE ALL THE
IMPORTANT BEES ARE OF THAT SEX IN THE HIVE THERE IS ONE MARRIED BEE
CALLED THE QUEEN SHE HAS FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN OF THESE ABOUT ONE
HUNDRED ARE SONS THE REST ARE DAUGHTERS SOME OF THE DAUGHTERS ARE
YOUNG MAIDS SOME ARE OLD MAIDS AND ALL ARE VIRGINS AND REMAIN SO

EVERY SPRING THE QUEEN COMES OUT OF THE HIVE AND FLIES AWAY WITH ONE OF
HER SONS AND MARRIES HIM THE HONEYMOON LASTS ONLY AN HOUR OR TWO THEN
THE QUEEN DIVORCES HER HUSBAND AND RETURNS HOME COMPETENT TO LAY TWO
MILLION EGGS THIS WILL BE ENOUGH TO LAST THE YEAR BUT NOT MORE THAN
ENOUGH BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF BEES GET DROWNED EVERY DAY AND OTHER
HUNDREDS ARE EATEN BY BIRDS AND IT IS THE QUEENS BUSINESS TO KEEP THE
POPULATION UP TO STANDARDSAY FIFTY THOUSAND SHE MUST ALWAYS HAVE
THAT MANY CHILDREN ON HAND AND EFFICIENT DURING THE BUSY SEASON WHICH
IS SUMMER OR WINTER WOULD CATCH THE COMMUNITY SHORT OF FOOD SHE LAYS
FROM TWO THOUSAND TO THREE THOUSAND EGGS A DAY ACCORDING TO THE
DEMAND AND SHE MUST EXERCISE JUDGMENT AND NOT LAY MORE THAN ARE
NEEDED IN A SLIM FLOWERHARVEST NOR FEWER THAN ARE REQUIRED IN A
PRODIGAL ONE OR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WILL DETHRONE HER AND ELECT A
QUEEN THAT HAS MORE SENSE

THERE ARE ALWAYS A FEW ROYAL HEIRS IN STOCK AND READY TO TAKE HER
PLACEREADY AND MORE THAN ANXIOUS TO DO IT ALTHOUGH SHE IS THEIR OWN
MOTHER THESE GIRLS ARE KEPT BY THEMSELVES AND ARE REGALLY FED AND
TENDED FROM BIRTH NO OTHER BEES GET SUCH FINE FOOD AS THEY GET OR
LIVE SUCH A HIGH AND LUXURIOUS LIFE BY CONSEQUENCE THEY ARE LARGER AND
LONGER AND SLEEKER THAN THEIR WORKING SISTERS AND THEY HAVE A CURVED
STING SHAPED LIKE A SCIMITAR WHILE THE OTHERS HAVE A STRAIGHT ONE

A COMMON BEE WILL STING ANY ONE OR ANYBODY BUT A ROYALTY STINGS
ROYALTIES ONLY A COMMON BEE WILL STING AND KILL ANOTHER COMMON BEE
FOR CAUSE BUT WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO KILL THE QUEEN OTHER WAYS ARE
EMPLOYED WHEN A QUEEN HAS GROWN OLD AND SLACK AND DOES NOT LAY EGGS
ENOUGH ONE OF HER ROYAL DAUGHTERS IS ALLOWED TO COME TO ATTACK HER THE
REST OF THE BEES LOOKING ON AT THE DUEL AND SEEING FAIR PLAY IT IS A
DUEL WITH THE CURVED STINGS IF ONE OF THE FIGHTERS GETS HARD PRESSED
AND GIVES IT UP AND RUNS SHE IS BROUGHT BACK AND MUST TRY AGAINONCE
MAYBE TWICE THEN IF SHE RUNS YET ONCE MORE FOR HER LIFE JUDICIAL
DEATH IS HER PORTION HER CHILDREN PACK THEMSELVES INTO A BALL AROUND
HER PERSON AND HOLD HER IN THAT COMPACT GRIP TWO OR THREE DAYS UNTIL
SHE STARVES TO DEATH OR IS SUFFOCATED MEANTIME THE VICTOR BEE IS
RECEIVING ROYAL HONORS AND PERFORMING THE ONE ROYAL FUNCTIONLAYING
EGGS

AS REGARDS THE ETHICS OF THE JUDICIAL ASSASSINATION OF THE QUEEN THAT
IS A MATTER OF POLITICS AND WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER IN ITS PROPER
PLACE

DURING SUBSTANTIALLY THE WHOLE OF HER SHORT LIFE OF FIVE OR SIX YEARS
THE QUEEN LIVES IN THE EGYPTIAN DARKNESS AND STATELY SECLUSION OF THE
ROYAL APARTMENTS WITH NONE ABOUT HER BUT PLEBEIAN SERVANTS WHO GIVE
HER EMPTY LIPAFFECTION IN PLACE OF THE LOVE WHICH HER HEART HUNGERS
FOR WHO SPY UPON HER IN THE INTEREST OF HER WAITING HEIRS AND REPORT
AND EXAGGERATE HER DEFECTS AND DEFICIENCIES TO THEM WHO FAWN UPON HER
AND FLATTER HER TO HER FACE AND SLANDER HER BEHIND HER BACK WHO GROVEL
BEFORE HER IN THE DAY OF HER POWER AND FORSAKE HER IN HER AGE AND
WEAKNESS THERE SHE SITS FRIENDLESS UPON HER THRONE THROUGH THE LONG
NIGHT OF HER LIFE CUT OFF FROM THE CONSOLING SYMPATHIES AND SWEET
COMPANIONSHIP AND LOVING ENDEARMENTS WHICH SHE CRAVES BY THE GILDED
BARRIERS OF HER AWFUL RANK A FORLORN EXILE IN HER OWN HOUSE AND HOME
WEARY OBJECT OF FORMAL CEREMONIES AND MACHINEMADE WORSHIP WINGED
CHILD OF THE SUN NATIVE TO THE FREE AIR AND THE BLUE SKIES AND THE
FLOWERY FIELDS DOOMED BY THE SPLENDID ACCIDENT OF HER BIRTH TO TRADE
THIS PRICELESS HERITAGE FOR A BLACK CAPTIVITY A TINSEL GRANDEUR AND A
LOVELESS LIFE WITH SHAME AND INSULT AT THE END AND A CRUEL DEATHAND
CONDEMNED BY THE HUMAN INSTINCT IN HER TO HOLD THE BARGAIN VALUABLE

HUBER LUBBOCK MAETERLINCKIN FACT ALL THE GREAT AUTHORITIESARE
AGREED IN DENYING THAT THE BEE IS A MEMBER OF THE HUMAN FAMILY I DO
NOT KNOW WHY THEY HAVE DONE THIS BUT I THINK IT IS FROM DISHONEST
MOTIVES WHY THE INNUMERABLE FACTS BROUGHT TO LIGHT BY THEIR OWN
PAINSTAKING AND EXHAUSTIVE EXPERIMENTS PROVE THAT IF THERE IS A MASTER
FOOL IN THE WORLD IT IS THE BEE THAT SEEMS TO SETTLE IT

BUT THAT IS THE WAY OF THE SCIENTIST HE WILL SPEND THIRTY YEARS IN
BUILDING UP A MOUNTAIN RANGE OF FACTS WITH THE INTENT TO PROVE A
CERTAIN THEORY THEN HE IS SO HAPPY IN HIS ACHIEVEMENT THAT AS A RULE
HE OVERLOOKS THE MAIN CHIEF FACT OF ALLTHAT HIS ACCUMULATION PROVES AN
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT THING WHEN YOU POINT OUT THIS MISCARRIAGE TO HIM HE
DOES NOT ANSWER YOUR LETTERS WHEN YOU CALL TO CONVINCE HIM THE
SERVANT PREVARICATES AND YOU DO NOT GET IN SCIENTISTS HAVE ODIOUS
MANNERS EXCEPT WHEN YOU PROP UP THEIR THEORY THEN YOU CAN BORROW
MONEY OF THEM

TO BE STRICTLY FAIR I WILL CONCEDE THAT NOW AND THEN ONE OF THEM WILL
ANSWER YOUR LETTER BUT WHEN THEY DO THEY AVOID THE ISSUEYOU CANNOT
PIN THEM DOWN WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT THE BEE WAS HUMAN I WROTE ABOUT
IT TO ALL THOSE SCIENTISTS WHOM I HAVE JUST MENTIONED FOR EVASIONS I
HAVE SEEN NOTHING TO EQUAL THE ANSWERS I GOT

AFTER THE QUEEN THE PERSONAGE NEXT IN IMPORTANCE IN THE HIVE IS THE
VIRGIN THE VIRGINS ARE FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND IN
NUMBER AND THEY ARE THE WORKERS THE LABORERS NO WORK IS DONE IN THE
HIVE OR OUT OF IT SAVE BY THEM THE MALES DO NOT WORK THE QUEEN DOES
NO WORK UNLESS LAYING EGGS IS WORK BUT IT DOES NOT SEEM SO TO ME
THERE ARE ONLY TWO MILLION OF THEM ANYWAY AND ALL OF FIVE MONTHS TO
FINISH THE CONTRACT IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF WORK IN A HIVE IS AS
CLEVERLY AND ELABORATELY SPECIALIZED AS IT IS IN A VAST AMERICAN
MACHINESHOP OR FACTORY A BEE THAT HAS BEEN TRAINED TO ONE OF THE MANY
AND VARIOUS INDUSTRIES OF THE CONCERN DOESNT KNOW HOW TO EXERCISE ANY
OTHER AND WOULD BE OFFENDED IF ASKED TO TAKE A HAND IN ANYTHING
OUTSIDE OF HER PROFESSION SHE IS AS HUMAN AS A COOK AND IF YOU SHOULD
ASK THE COOK TO WAIT ON THE TABLE YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN COOKS
WILL PLAY THE PIANO IF YOU LIKE BUT THEY DRAW THE LINE THERE IN MY
TIME I HAVE ASKED A COOK TO CHOP WOOD AND I KNOW ABOUT THESE THINGS
EVEN THE HIRED GIRL HAS HER FRONTIERS TRUE THEY ARE VAGUE THEY ARE
ILLDEFINED EVEN FLEXIBLE BUT THEY ARE THERE THIS IS NOT CONJECTURE
IT IS FOUNDED ON THE ABSOLUTE AND THEN THE BUTLER YOU ASK THE BUTLER
TO WASH THE DOG IT IS JUST AS I SAY THERE IS MUCH TO BE LEARNED IN
THESE WAYS WITHOUT GOING TO BOOKS BOOKS ARE VERY WELL BUT BOOKS DO
NOT COVER THE WHOLE DOMAIN OF ESTHETIC HUMAN CULTURE PRIDE OF
PROFESSION IS ONE OF THE BONIEST BONES IN EXISTENCE IF NOT THE
BONIEST WITHOUT DOUBT IT IS SO IN THE HIVE




TAMING THE BICYCLE


WRITTEN ABOUT NOT BEFORE PUBLISHED

IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES MARK TWAIN LEARNED TO RIDE ONE OF THE OLD
HIGHWHEEL BICYCLES OF THAT PERIOD HE WROTE AN ACCOUNT OF HIS
EXPERIENCE BUT DID NOT OFFER IT FOR PUBLICATION THE FORM OF BICYCLE
HE RODE LONG AGO BECAME ANTIQUATED BUT IN THE HUMOR OF HIS PLEASANTRY
IS A QUALITY WHICH DOES NOT GROW OLD

A B P I

I THOUGHT THE MATTER OVER AND CONCLUDED I COULD DO IT SO I WENT DOWN
AND BOUGHT A BARREL OF PONDS EXTRACT AND A BICYCLE THE EXPERT CAME
HOME WITH ME TO INSTRUCT ME WE CHOSE THE BACK YARD FOR THE SAKE OF
PRIVACY AND WENT TO WORK

MINE WAS NOT A FULLGROWN BICYCLE BUT ONLY A COLTA FIFTYINCH WITH
THE PEDALS SHORTENED UP TO FORTYEIGHTAND SKITTISH LIKE ANY OTHER
COLT THE EXPERT EXPLAINED THE THINGS POINTS BRIEFLY THEN HE GOT ON
ITS BACK AND RODE AROUND A LITTLE TO SHOW ME HOW EASY IT WAS TO DO HE
SAID THAT THE DISMOUNTING WAS PERHAPS THE HARDEST THING TO LEARN AND
SO WE WOULD LEAVE THAT TO THE LAST BUT HE WAS IN ERROR THERE HE
FOUND TO HIS SURPRISE AND JOY THAT ALL THAT HE NEEDED TO DO WAS TO
GET ME ON TO THE MACHINE AND STAND OUT OF THE WAY I COULD GET OFF
MYSELF ALTHOUGH I WAS WHOLLY INEXPERIENCED I DISMOUNTED IN THE BEST
TIME ON RECORD HE WAS ON THAT SIDE SHOVING UP THE MACHINE WE ALL
CAME DOWN WITH A CRASH HE AT THE BOTTOM I NEXT AND THE MACHINE ON
TOP

WE EXAMINED THE MACHINE BUT IT WAS NOT IN THE LEAST INJURED THIS WAS
HARDLY BELIEVABLE YET THE EXPERT ASSURED ME THAT IT WAS TRUE IN FACT
THE EXAMINATION PROVED IT I WAS PARTLY TO REALIZE THEN HOW ADMIRABLY
THESE THINGS ARE CONSTRUCTED WE APPLIED SOME PONDS EXTRACT AND
RESUMED THE EXPERT GOT ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SHOVE UP THIS TIME BUT
I DISMOUNTED ON THAT SIDE SO THE RESULT WAS AS BEFORE

THE MACHINE WAS NOT HURT WE OILED OURSELVES UP AGAIN AND RESUMED
THIS TIME THE EXPERT TOOK UP A SHELTERED POSITION BEHIND BUT SOMEHOW
OR OTHER WE LANDED ON HIM AGAIN

HE WAS FULL OF SURPRISED ADMIRATION SAID IT WAS ABNORMAL SHE WAS ALL
RIGHT NOT A SCRATCH ON HER NOT A TIMBER STARTED ANYWHERE I SAID IT
WAS WONDERFUL WHILE WE WERE GREASING UP BUT HE SAID THAT WHEN I CAME
TO KNOW THESE STEEL SPIDERWEBS I WOULD REALIZE THAT NOTHING BUT
DYNAMITE COULD CRIPPLE THEM THEN HE LIMPED OUT TO POSITION AND WE
RESUMED ONCE MORE THIS TIME THE EXPERT TOOK UP THE POSITION OF
SHORTSTOP AND GOT A MAN TO SHOVE UP BEHIND WE GOT UP A HANDSOME
SPEED AND PRESENTLY TRAVERSED A BRICK AND I WENT OUT OVER THE TOP OF
THE TILLER AND LANDED HEAD DOWN ON THE INSTRUCTORS BACK AND SAW THE
MACHINE FLUTTERING IN THE AIR BETWEEN ME AND THE SUN IT WAS WELL IT
CAME DOWN ON US FOR THAT BROKE THE FALL AND IT WAS NOT INJURED

FIVE DAYS LATER I GOT OUT AND WAS CARRIED DOWN TO THE HOSPITAL AND
FOUND THE EXPERT DOING PRETTY FAIRLY IN A FEW MORE DAYS I WAS QUITE
SOUND I ATTRIBUTE THIS TO MY PRUDENCE IN ALWAYS DISMOUNTING ON
SOMETHING SOFT SOME RECOMMEND A FEATHER BED BUT I THINK AN EXPERT IS
BETTER

THE EXPERT GOT OUT AT LAST BROUGHT FOUR ASSISTANTS WITH HIM IT WAS A
GOOD IDEA THESE FOUR HELD THE GRACEFUL COBWEB UPRIGHT WHILE I CLIMBED
INTO THE SADDLE THEN THEY FORMED IN COLUMN AND MARCHED ON EITHER SIDE
OF ME WHILE THE EXPERT PUSHED BEHIND ALL HANDS ASSISTED AT THE
DISMOUNT

THE BICYCLE HAD WHAT IS CALLED THE WABBLES AND HAD THEM VERY BADLY
IN ORDER TO KEEP MY POSITION A GOOD MANY THINGS WERE REQUIRED OF ME
AND IN EVERY INSTANCE THE THING REQUIRED WAS AGAINST NATURE AGAINST
NATURE BUT NOT AGAINST THE LAWS OF NATURE THAT IS TO SAY THAT
WHATEVER THE NEEDED THING MIGHT BE MY NATURE HABIT AND BREEDING
MOVED ME TO ATTEMPT IT IN ONE WAY WHILE SOME IMMUTABLE AND UNSUSPECTED
LAW OF PHYSICS REQUIRED THAT IT BE DONE IN JUST THE OTHER WAY I
PERCEIVED BY THIS HOW RADICALLY AND GROTESQUELY WRONG HAD BEEN THE
LIFELONG EDUCATION OF MY BODY AND MEMBERS THEY WERE STEEPED IN
IGNORANCE THEY KNEW NOTHINGNOTHING WHICH IT COULD PROFIT THEM TO
KNOW FOR INSTANCE IF I FOUND MYSELF FALLING TO THE RIGHT I PUT THE
TILLER HARD DOWN THE OTHER WAY BY A QUITE NATURAL IMPULSE AND SO
VIOLATED A LAW AND KEPT ON GOING DOWN THE LAW REQUIRED THE OPPOSITE
THINGTHE BIG WHEEL MUST BE TURNED IN THE DIRECTION IN WHICH YOU ARE
FALLING IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THIS WHEN YOU ARE TOLD IT AND NOT
MERELY HARD TO BELIEVE IT BUT IMPOSSIBLE IT IS OPPOSED TO ALL YOUR
NOTIONS AND IT IS JUST AS HARD TO DO IT AFTER YOU DO COME TO BELIEVE
IT BELIEVING IT AND KNOWING BY THE MOST CONVINCING PROOF THAT IT IS
TRUE DOES NOT HELP IT YOU CANT ANY MORE DO IT THAN YOU COULD BEFORE
YOU CAN NEITHER FORCE NOR PERSUADE YOURSELF TO DO IT AT FIRST THE
INTELLECT HAS TO COME TO THE FRONT NOW IT HAS TO TEACH THE LIMBS TO
DISCARD THEIR OLD EDUCATION AND ADOPT THE NEW

THE STEPS OF ONES PROGRESS ARE DISTINCTLY MARKED AT THE END OF EACH
LESSON HE KNOWS HE HAS ACQUIRED SOMETHING AND HE ALSO KNOWS WHAT THAT
SOMETHING IS AND LIKEWISE THAT IT WILL STAY WITH HIM IT IS NOT LIKE
STUDYING GERMAN WHERE YOU MULL ALONG IN A GROPING UNCERTAIN WAY FOR
THIRTY YEARS AND AT LAST JUST AS YOU THINK YOUVE GOT IT THEY SPRING
THE SUBJUNCTIVE ON YOU AND THERE YOU ARE NOAND I SEE NOW PLAINLY
ENOUGH THAT THE GREAT PITY ABOUT THE GERMAN LANGUAGE IS THAT YOU
CANT FALL OFF IT AND HURT YOURSELF THERE IS NOTHING LIKE THAT FEATURE
TO MAKE YOU ATTEND STRICTLY TO BUSINESS BUT I ALSO SEE BY WHAT I HAVE
LEARNED OF BICYCLING THAT THE RIGHT AND ONLY SURE WAY TO LEARN GERMAN
IS BY THE BICYCLING METHOD THAT IS TO SAY TAKE A GRIP ON ONE VILLAINY
OF IT AT A TIME AND LEARN ITNOT EASE UP AND SHIRK TO THE NEXT
LEAVING THAT ONE HALF LEARNED

WHEN YOU HAVE REACHED THE POINT IN BICYCLING WHERE YOU CAN BALANCE THE
MACHINE TOLERABLY FAIRLY AND PROPEL IT AND STEER IT THEN COMES YOUR
NEXT TASKHOW TO MOUNT IT YOU DO IT IN THIS WAY YOU HOP ALONG BEHIND
IT ON YOUR RIGHT FOOT RESTING THE OTHER ON THE MOUNTINGPEG AND
GRASPING THE TILLER WITH YOUR HANDS AT THE WORD YOU RISE ON THE PEG
STIFFEN YOUR LEFT LEG HANG YOUR OTHER ONE AROUND IN THE AIR IN A
GENERAL IN INDEFINITE WAY LEAN YOUR STOMACH AGAINST THE REAR OF THE
SADDLE AND THEN FALL OFF MAYBE ON ONE SIDE MAYBE ON THE OTHER BUT
YOU FALL OFF YOU GET UP AND DO IT AGAIN AND ONCE MORE AND THEN
SEVERAL TIMES

BY THIS TIME YOU HAVE LEARNED TO KEEP YOUR BALANCE AND ALSO TO STEER
WITHOUT WRENCHING THE TILLER OUT BY THE ROOTS I SAY TILLER BECAUSE IT
IS A TILLER HANDLEBAR IS A LAMELY DESCRIPTIVE PHRASE SO YOU STEER
ALONG STRAIGHT AHEAD A LITTLE WHILE THEN YOU RISE FORWARD WITH A
STEADY STRAIN BRINGING YOUR RIGHT LEG AND THEN YOUR BODY INTO THE
SADDLE CATCH YOUR BREATH FETCH A VIOLENT HITCH THIS WAY AND THEN
THAT AND DOWN YOU GO AGAIN

BUT YOU HAVE CEASED TO MIND THE GOING DOWN BY THIS TIME YOU ARE
GETTING TO LIGHT ON ONE FOOT OR THE OTHER WITH CONSIDERABLE CERTAINTY
SIX MORE ATTEMPTS AND SIX MORE FALLS MAKE YOU PERFECT YOU LAND IN THE
SADDLE COMFORTABLY NEXT TIME AND STAY THERETHAT IS IF YOU CAN BE
CONTENT TO LET YOUR LEGS DANGLE AND LEAVE THE PEDALS ALONE A WHILE
BUT IF YOU GRAB AT ONCE FOR THE PEDALS YOU ARE GONE AGAIN YOU SOON
LEARN TO WAIT A LITTLE AND PERFECT YOUR BALANCE BEFORE REACHING FOR THE
PEDALS THEN THE MOUNTINGART IS ACQUIRED IS COMPLETE AND A LITTLE
PRACTICE WILL MAKE IT SIMPLE AND EASY TO YOU THOUGH SPECTATORS OUGHT
TO KEEP OFF A ROD OR TWO TO ONE SIDE ALONG AT FIRST IF YOU HAVE
NOTHING AGAINST THEM

AND NOW YOU COME TO THE VOLUNTARY DISMOUNT YOU LEARNED THE OTHER KIND
FIRST OF ALL IT IS QUITE EASY TO TELL ONE HOW TO DO THE VOLUNTARY
DISMOUNT THE WORDS ARE FEW THE REQUIREMENT SIMPLE AND APPARENTLY
UNDIFFICULT LET YOUR LEFT PEDAL GO DOWN TILL YOUR LEFT LEG IS NEARLY
STRAIGHT TURN YOUR WHEEL TO THE LEFT AND GET OFF AS YOU WOULD FROM A
HORSE IT CERTAINLY DOES SOUND EXCEEDINGLY EASY BUT IT ISNT I DONT
KNOW WHY IT ISNT BUT IT ISNT TRY AS YOU MAY YOU DONT GET DOWN AS
YOU WOULD FROM A HORSE YOU GET DOWN AS YOU WOULD FROM A HOUSE AFIRE
YOU MAKE A SPECTACLE OF YOURSELF EVERY TIME

II

DURING THE EIGHT DAYS I TOOK A DAILY LESSON OF AN HOUR AND A HALF AT
THE END OF THIS TWELVE WORKINGHOURS APPRENTICESHIP I WAS GRADUATEDIN
THE ROUGH I WAS PRONOUNCED COMPETENT TO PADDLE MY OWN BICYCLE WITHOUT
OUTSIDE HELP IT SEEMS INCREDIBLE THIS CELERITY OF ACQUIREMENT IT
TAKES CONSIDERABLY LONGER THAN THAT TO LEARN HORSEBACKRIDING IN THE
ROUGH

NOW IT IS TRUE THAT I COULD HAVE LEARNED WITHOUT A TEACHER BUT IT
WOULD HAVE BEEN RISKY FOR ME BECAUSE OF MY NATURAL CLUMSINESS THE
SELFTAUGHT MAN SELDOM KNOWS ANYTHING ACCURATELY AND HE DOES NOT KNOW
A TENTH AS MUCH AS HE COULD HAVE KNOWN IF HE HAD WORKED UNDER TEACHERS
AND BESIDES HE BRAGS AND IS THE MEANS OF FOOLING OTHER THOUGHTLESS
PEOPLE INTO GOING AND DOING AS HE HIMSELF HAS DONE THERE ARE THOSE WHO
IMAGINE THAT THE UNLUCKY ACCIDENTS OF LIFELIFES EXPERIENCESARE IN
SOME WAY USEFUL TO US I WISH I COULD FIND OUT HOW I NEVER KNEW ONE OF
THEM TO HAPPEN TWICE THEY ALWAYS CHANGE OFF AND SWAP AROUND AND CATCH
YOU ON YOUR INEXPERIENCED SIDE IF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE CAN BE WORTH
ANYTHING AS AN EDUCATION IT WOULDNT SEEM LIKELY THAT YOU COULD TRIP
METHUSELAH AND YET IF THAT OLD PERSON COULD COME BACK HERE IT IS MORE
THAN LIKELY THAT ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE WOULD DO WOULD BE TO TAKE
HOLD OF ONE OF THESE ELECTRIC WIRES AND TIE HIMSELF ALL UP IN A KNOT
NOW THE SURER THING AND THE WISER THING WOULD BE FOR HIM TO ASK
SOMEBODY WHETHER IT WAS A GOOD THING TO TAKE HOLD OF BUT THAT WOULD
NOT SUIT HIM HE WOULD BE ONE OF THE SELFTAUGHT KIND THAT GO BY
EXPERIENCE HE WOULD WANT TO EXAMINE FOR HIMSELF AND HE WOULD FIND
FOR HIS INSTRUCTION THAT THE COILED PATRIARCH SHUNS THE ELECTRIC WIRE
AND IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO HIM TOO AND WOULD LEAVE HIS EDUCATION IN
QUITE A COMPLETE AND ROUNDEDOUT CONDITION TILL HE SHOULD COME AGAIN
SOME DAY AND GO TO BOUNCING A DYNAMITECAN AROUND TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS
IN IT

BUT WE WANDER FROM THE POINT HOWEVER GET A TEACHER IT SAVES MUCH
TIME AND PONDS EXTRACT

BEFORE TAKING FINAL LEAVE OF ME MY INSTRUCTOR INQUIRED CONCERNING MY
PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND I WAS ABLE TO INFORM HIM THAT I HADNT ANY HE
SAID THAT THAT WAS A DEFECT WHICH WOULD MAKE UPHILL WHEELING PRETTY
DIFFICULT FOR ME AT FIRST BUT HE ALSO SAID THE BICYCLE WOULD SOON
REMOVE IT THE CONTRAST BETWEEN HIS MUSCLES AND MINE WAS QUITE MARKED
HE WANTED TO TEST MINE SO I OFFERED MY BICEPSWHICH WAS MY BEST IT
ALMOST MADE HIM SMILE HE SAID IT IS PULPY AND SOFT AND YIELDING
AND ROUNDED IT EVADES PRESSURE AND GLIDES FROM UNDER THE FINGERS IN
THE DARK A BODY MIGHT THINK IT WAS AN OYSTER IN A RAG PERHAPS THIS
MADE ME LOOK GRIEVED FOR HE ADDED BRISKLY OH THATS ALL RIGHT YOU
NEEDNT WORRY ABOUT THAT IN A LITTLE WHILE YOU CANT TELL IT FROM A
PETRIFIED KIDNEY JUST GO RIGHT ALONG WITH YOUR PRACTICE YOURE ALL
RIGHT

THEN HE LEFT ME AND I STARTED OUT ALONE TO SEEK ADVENTURES YOU DONT
REALLY HAVE TO SEEK THEMTHAT IS NOTHING BUT A PHRASETHEY COME TO YOU

I CHOSE A REPOSEFUL SABBATHDAY SORT OF A BACK STREET WHICH WAS ABOUT
THIRTY YARDS WIDE BETWEEN THE CURBSTONES I KNEW IT WAS NOT WIDE
ENOUGH STILL I THOUGHT THAT BY KEEPING STRICT WATCH AND WASTING NO
SPACE UNNECESSARILY I COULD CROWD THROUGH

OF COURSE I HAD TROUBLE MOUNTING THE MACHINE ENTIRELY ON MY OWN
RESPONSIBILITY WITH NO ENCOURAGING MORAL SUPPORT FROM THE OUTSIDE NO
SYMPATHETIC INSTRUCTOR TO SAY GOOD NOW YOURE DOING WELLGOOD
AGAINDONT HURRYTHERE NOW YOURE ALL RIGHTBRACE UP GO AHEAD IN
PLACE OF THIS I HAD SOME OTHER SUPPORT THIS WAS A BOY WHO WAS PERCHED
ON A GATEPOST MUNCHING A HUNK OF MAPLE SUGAR

HE WAS FULL OF INTEREST AND COMMENT THE FIRST TIME I FAILED AND WENT
DOWN HE SAID THAT IF HE WAS ME HE WOULD DRESS UP IN PILLOWS THATS
WHAT HE WOULD DO THE NEXT TIME I WENT DOWN HE ADVISED ME TO GO AND
LEARN TO RIDE A TRICYCLE FIRST THE THIRD TIME I COLLAPSED HE SAID HE
DIDNT BELIEVE I COULD STAY ON A HORSECAR BUT THE NEXT TIME I
SUCCEEDED AND GOT CLUMSILY UNDER WAY IN A WEAVING TOTTERING
UNCERTAIN FASHION AND OCCUPYING PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE STREET MY SLOW
AND LUMBERING GAIT FILLED THE BOY TO THE CHIN WITH SCORN AND HE SUNG
OUT MY BUT DONT HE RIP ALONG THEN HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS POST AND
LOAFED ALONG THE SIDEWALK STILL OBSERVING AND OCCASIONALLY COMMENTING
PRESENTLY HE DROPPED INTO MY WAKE AND FOLLOWED ALONG BEHIND A LITTLE
GIRL PASSED BY BALANCING A WASHBOARD ON HER HEAD AND GIGGLED AND
SEEMED ABOUT TO MAKE A REMARK BUT THE BOY SAID REBUKINGLY LET HIM
ALONE HES GOING TO A FUNERAL

I HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH THAT STREET FOR YEARS AND HAD ALWAYS
SUPPOSED IT WAS A DEAD LEVEL BUT IT WAS NOT AS THE BICYCLE NOW
INFORMED ME TO MY SURPRISE THE BICYCLE IN THE HANDS OF A NOVICE IS
AS ALERT AND ACUTE AS A SPIRITLEVEL IN THE DETECTING OF DELICATE AND
VANISHING SHADES OF DIFFERENCE IN THESE MATTERS IT NOTICES A RISE
WHERE YOUR UNTRAINED EYE WOULD NOT OBSERVE THAT ONE EXISTED IT NOTICES
ANY DECLINE WHICH WATER WILL RUN DOWN I WAS TOILING UP A SLIGHT RISE
BUT WAS NOT AWARE OF IT IT MADE ME TUG AND PANT AND PERSPIRE AND
STILL LABOR AS I MIGHT THE MACHINE CAME ALMOST TO A STANDSTILL EVERY
LITTLE WHILE AT SUCH TIMES THE BOY WOULD SAY THATS IT TAKE A
RESTTHERE AINT NO HURRY THEY CANT HOLD THE FUNERAL WITHOUT YOU

STONES WERE A BOTHER TO ME EVEN THE SMALLEST ONES GAVE ME A PANIC WHEN
I WENT OVER THEM I COULD HIT ANY KIND OF A STONE NO MATTER HOW SMALL
IF I TRIED TO MISS IT AND OF COURSE AT FIRST I COULDNT HELP TRYING TO
DO THAT IT IS BUT NATURAL IT IS PART OF THE ASS THAT IS PUT IN US
ALL FOR SOME INSCRUTABLE REASON

I WAS AT THE END OF MY COURSE AT LAST AND IT WAS NECESSARY FOR ME TO
ROUND TO THIS IS NOT A PLEASANT THING WHEN YOU UNDERTAKE IT FOR THE
FIRST TIME ON YOUR OWN RESPONSIBILITY AND NEITHER IS IT LIKELY TO
SUCCEED YOUR CONFIDENCE OOZES AWAY YOU FILL STEADILY UP WITH NAMELESS
APPREHENSIONS EVERY FIBER OF YOU IS TENSE WITH A WATCHFUL STRAIN YOU
START A CAUTIOUS AND GRADUAL CURVE BUT YOUR SQUIRMY NERVES ARE ALL
FULL OF ELECTRIC ANXIETIES SO THE CURVE IS QUICKLY DEMORALIZED INTO A
JERKY AND PERILOUS ZIGZAG THEN SUDDENLY THE NICKELCLAD HORSE TAKES
THE BIT IN ITS MOUTH AND GOES SLANTING FOR THE CURBSTONE DEFYING ALL
PRAYERS AND ALL YOUR POWERS TO CHANGE ITS MINDYOUR HEART STANDS STILL
YOUR BREATH HANGS FIRE YOUR LEGS FORGET TO WORK STRAIGHT ON YOU GO
AND THERE ARE BUT A COUPLE OF FEET BETWEEN YOU AND THE CURB NOW AND
NOW IS THE DESPERATE MOMENT THE LAST CHANCE TO SAVE YOURSELF OF
COURSE ALL YOUR INSTRUCTIONS FLY OUT OF YOUR HEAD AND YOU WHIRL YOUR
WHEEL AWAY FROM THE CURB INSTEAD OF TOWARD IT AND SO YOU GO SPRAWLING
ON THAT GRANITEBOUND INHOSPITABLE SHORE THAT WAS MY LUCK THAT WAS MY
EXPERIENCE I DRAGGED MYSELF OUT FROM UNDER THE INDESTRUCTIBLE BICYCLE
AND SAT DOWN ON THE CURB TO EXAMINE

I STARTED ON THE RETURN TRIP IT WAS NOW THAT I SAW A FARMERS WAGON
POKING ALONG DOWN TOWARD ME LOADED WITH CABBAGES IF I NEEDED ANYTHING
TO PERFECT THE PRECARIOUSNESS OF MY STEERING IT WAS JUST THAT THE
FARMER WAS OCCUPYING THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD WITH HIS WAGON LEAVING
BARELY FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN YARDS OF SPACE ON EITHER SIDE I COULDNT
SHOUT AT HIMA BEGINNER CANT SHOUT IF HE OPENS HIS MOUTH HE IS GONE
HE MUST KEEP ALL HIS ATTENTION ON HIS BUSINESS BUT IN THIS GRISLY
EMERGENCY THE BOY CAME TO THE RESCUE AND FOR ONCE I HAD TO BE
GRATEFUL TO HIM HE KEPT A SHARP LOOKOUT ON THE SWIFTLY VARYING
IMPULSES AND INSPIRATIONS OF MY BICYCLE AND SHOUTED TO THE MAN
ACCORDINGLY

TO THE LEFT TURN TO THE LEFT OR THIS JACKASS LL RUN OVER YOU THE
MAN STARTED TO DO IT NO TO THE RIGHT TO THE RIGHT HOLD ON THAT
WONT DOTO THE LEFTTO THE RIGHTTO THE LEFTRIGHT LEFTRISTAY
WHERE YOU ARE OR YOURE A GONER

AND JUST THEN I CAUGHT THE OFF HORSE IN THE STARBOARD AND WENT DOWN IN
A PILE I SAID HANG IT COULDNT YOU SEE I WAS COMING

YES I SEE YOU WAS COMING BUT I COULDNT TELL WHICH WAY YOU WAS
COMING NOBODY COULDNOW COULD THEY YOU COULDNT YOURSELFNOW
COULD YOU SO WHAT COULD I DO

THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THAT AND SO I HAD THE MAGNANIMITY TO SAY SO I
SAID I WAS NO DOUBT AS MUCH TO BLAME AS HE WAS

WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE DAYS I ACHIEVED SO MUCH PROGRESS THAT THE BOY
COULDNT KEEP UP WITH ME HE HAD TO GO BACK TO HIS GATEPOST AND
CONTENT HIMSELF WITH WATCHING ME FALL AT LONG RANGE

THERE WAS A ROW OF LOW STEPPINGSTONES ACROSS ONE END OF THE STREET A
MEASURED YARD APART EVEN AFTER I GOT SO I COULD STEER PRETTY FAIRLY I
WAS SO AFRAID OF THOSE STONES THAT I ALWAYS HIT THEM THEY GAVE ME THE
WORST FALLS I EVER GOT IN THAT STREET EXCEPT THOSE WHICH I GOT FROM
DOGS I HAVE SEEN IT STATED THAT NO EXPERT IS QUICK ENOUGH TO RUN OVER
A DOG THAT A DOG IS ALWAYS ABLE TO SKIP OUT OF HIS WAY I THINK THAT
THAT MAY BE TRUE BUT I THINK THAT THE REASON HE COULDNT RUN OVER THE
DOG WAS BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO I DID NOT TRY TO RUN OVER ANY DOG
BUT I RAN OVER EVERY DOG THAT CAME ALONG I THINK IT MAKES A GREAT DEAL
OF DIFFERENCE IF YOU TRY TO RUN OVER THE DOG HE KNOWS HOW TO
CALCULATE BUT IF YOU ARE TRYING TO MISS HIM HE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO
CALCULATE AND IS LIABLE TO JUMP THE WRONG WAY EVERY TIME IT WAS
ALWAYS SO IN MY EXPERIENCE EVEN WHEN I COULD NOT HIT A WAGON I COULD
HIT A DOG THAT CAME TO SEE ME PRACTICE THEY ALL LIKED TO SEE ME
PRACTICE AND THEY ALL CAME FOR THERE WAS VERY LITTLE GOING ON IN OUR
NEIGHBORHOOD TO ENTERTAIN A DOG IT TOOK TIME TO LEARN TO MISS A DOG
BUT I ACHIEVED EVEN THAT

I CAN STEER AS WELL AS I WANT TO NOW AND I WILL CATCH THAT BOY OUT
ONE OF THESE DAYS AND RUN OVER HIM IF HE DOESNT REFORM

GET A BICYCLE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT IF YOU LIVE

RESENTMENT ACCORDING TO WHICH SIDE WE HITCH OURSELVES TO IT HAS
ALWAYS BEEN SO WITH THE HUMAN RACE THERE WAS NEVER A CLAIMANT THAT
COULDNT GET A HEARING NOR ONE THAT COULDNT ACCUMULATE A RAPTUROUS
FOLLOWING NO MATTER HOW FLIMSY AND APPARENTLY UNAUTHENTIC HIS CLAIM
MIGHT BE ARTHUR ORTONS CLAIM THAT HE WAS THE LOST TICHBORNE BARONET

FOLLOWING IT DOESNT MATTER WHO THEY ARE NOR WHAT THEY CLAIM NOR
WHETHER THEY COME WITH DOCUMENTS OR WITHOUT IT WAS ALWAYS SO DOWN OUT
OF THE LONGVANISHED PAST ACROSS THE ABYSS OF THE AGES IF YOU LISTEN
YOU CAN STILL HEAR THE BELIEVING MULTITUDES SHOUTING FOR PERKIN WARBECK
AND LAMBERT SIMNEL

A FRIEND HAS SENT ME A NEW BOOK FROM ENGLANDTHE SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM
RESTATEDWELL RESTATED AND CLOSELY REASONED AND MY FIFTY YEARS
INTEREST IN THAT MATTERASLEEP FOR THE LAST THREE YEARSIS EXCITED ONCE
MORE IT IS AN INTEREST WHICH WAS BORN OF DELIA BACONS BOOKAWAY BACK
IN THAT ANCIENT DAY OR MAYBE ABOUT A YEAR LATER MY
PILOTMASTER BIXBY TRANSFERRED ME FROM HIS OWN STEAMBOAT TO THE
PENNSYLVANIA AND PLACED ME UNDER THE ORDERS AND INSTRUCTIONS OF
GEORGE EALERDEAD NOW THESE MANY MANY YEARS I STEERED FOR HIM A GOOD
MANY MONTHSAS WAS THE HUMBLE DUTY OF THE PILOTAPPRENTICE STOOD A
DAYLIGHT WATCH AND SPUN THE WHEEL UNDER THE SEVERE SUPERINTENDENCE AND
CORRECTION OF THE MASTER HE WAS A PRIME CHESSPLAYER AND AN IDOLATER
OF SHAKESPEARE HE WOULD PLAY CHESS WITH ANYBODY EVEN WITH ME AND IT
COST HIS OFFICIAL DIGNITY SOMETHING TO DO THAT ALSOQUITE UNINVITEDHE
WOULD READ SHAKESPEARE TO ME NOT JUST CASUALLY BUT BY THE HOUR WHEN
IT WAS HIS WATCH AND I WAS STEERING HE READ WELL BUT NOT PROFITABLY
FOR ME BECAUSE HE CONSTANTLY INJECTED COMMANDS INTO THE TEXT THAT
BROKE IT ALL UP MIXED IT ALL UP TANGLED IT ALL UPTO THAT DEGREE IN
FACT THAT IF WE WERE IN A RISKY AND DIFFICULT PIECE OF RIVER AN
IGNORANT PERSON COULDNT HAVE TOLD SOMETIMES WHICH OBSERVATIONS WERE
SHAKESPEARES AND WHICH WERE EALERS FOR INSTANCE

WHAT MAN DARE I DARE
APPROACH THOU WHAT ARE YOU LAYING IN THE LEADS FOR WHAT A HELL
OF AN IDEA LIKE THE RUGGED EASE HER OFF A LITTLE EASE HER OFF
RUGGED RUSSIAN BEAR THE ARMED RHINOCEROS OR THE THERE SHE GOES
MEET HER MEET HER DIDNT YOU KNOW SHED SMELL THE REEF IF YOU
CROWDED IT LIKE THAT HYRCAN TIGER TAKE ANY SHAPE BUT THAT AND MY
FIRM NERVES SHELL BE IN THE WOODS THE FIRST YOU KNOW STOP THE
STARBOARD COME AHEAD STRONG ON THE LARBOARD BACK THE
STARBOARD NOW THEN YOURE ALL RIGHT COME AHEAD ON THE
STARBOARD STRAIGHTEN UP AND GO LONG NEVER TREMBLE OR BE ALIVE
AGAIN AND DARE ME TO THE DESERT DAMNATION CANT YOU KEEP AWAY
FROM THAT GREASY WATER PULL HER DOWN SNATCH HER SNATCH HER
BALDHEADED WITH THY SWORD IF TREMBLING I INHABIT THEN LAY IN THE
LEADSNO ONLY WITH THE STARBOARD ONE LEAVE THE OTHER ALONE
PROTEST ME THE BABY OF A GIRL HENCE HORRIBLE SHADOW EIGHT
BELLSTHAT WATCHMANS ASLEEP AGAIN I RECKON GO DOWN AND CALL
BROWN YOURSELF UNREAL MOCKERY HENCE


HE CERTAINLY WAS A GOOD READER AND SPLENDIDLY THRILLING AND STORMY AND
TRAGIC BUT IT WAS A DAMAGE TO ME BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER SINCE BEEN ABLE
TO READ SHAKESPEARE IN A CALM AND SANE WAY I CANNOT RID IT OF HIS
EXPLOSIVE INTERLARDINGS THEY BREAK IN EVERYWHERE WITH THEIR
IRRELEVANT WHAT IN HELL ARE YOU UP TO NOW PULL HER DOWN MORE
MORETHERE NOW STEADY AS YOU GO AND THE OTHER DISORGANIZING
INTERRUPTIONS THAT WERE ALWAYS LEAPING FROM HIS MOUTH WHEN I READ
SHAKESPEARE NOW I CAN HEAR THEM AS PLAINLY AS I DID IN THAT
LONGDEPARTED TIMEFIFTYONE YEARS AGO I NEVER REGARDED EALERS
READINGS AS EDUCATIONAL INDEED THEY WERE A DETRIMENT TO ME

HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TEXT SELDOM IMPROVED IT BUT BARRING THAT
DETAIL HE WAS A GOOD READER I CAN SAY THAT MUCH FOR HIM HE DID NOT
USE THE BOOK AND DID NOT NEED TO HE KNEW HIS SHAKESPEARE AS WELL AS
EUCLID EVER KNEW HIS MULTIPLICATION TABLE

DID HE HAVE SOMETHING TO SAYTHIS SHAKESPEAREADORING MISSISSIPPI
PILOTANENT DELIA BACONS BOOK

YES AND HE SAID IT SAID IT ALL THE TIME FOR MONTHSIN THE MORNING
WATCH THE MIDDLE WATCH AND DOG WATCH AND PROBABLY KEPT IT GOING IN
HIS SLEEP HE BOUGHT THE LITERATURE OF THE DISPUTE AS FAST AS IT
APPEARED AND WE DISCUSSED IT ALL THROUGH THIRTEEN HUNDRED MILES OF
RIVER FOUR TIMES TRAVERSED IN EVERY THIRTYFIVE DAYSTHE TIME REQUIRED
BY THAT SWIFT BOAT TO ACHIEVE TWO ROUND TRIPS WE DISCUSSED AND
DISCUSSED AND DISCUSSED AND DISPUTED AND DISPUTED AND DISPUTED AT
ANY RATE HE DID AND I GOT IN A WORD NOW AND THEN WHEN HE SLIPPED A
COG AND THERE WAS A VACANCY HE DID HIS ARGUING WITH HEAT WITH ENERGY
WITH VIOLENCE AND I DID MINE WITH THE RESERVE AND MODERATION OF A
SUBORDINATE WHO DOES NOT LIKE TO BE FLUNG OUT OF A PILOTHOUSE THAT IS
PERCHED FORTY FEET ABOVE THE WATER HE WAS FIERCELY LOYAL TO
SHAKESPEARE AND CORDIALLY SCORNFUL OF BACON AND OF ALL THE PRETENSIONS
OF THE BACONIANS SO WAS IAT FIRST AND AT FIRST HE WAS GLAD THAT THAT
WAS MY ATTITUDE THERE WERE EVEN INDICATIONS THAT HE ADMIRED IT
INDICATIONS DIMMED IT IS TRUE BY THE DISTANCE THAT LAY BETWEEN THE
LOFTY BOSSPILOTICAL ALTITUDE AND MY LOWLY ONE YET PERCEPTIBLE TO ME
PERCEPTIBLE AND TRANSLATABLE INTO A COMPLIMENTCOMPLIMENT COMING DOWN
FROM ABOVE THE SNOWLINE AND NOT WELL THAWED IN THE TRANSIT AND NOT
LIKELY TO SET ANYTHING AFIRE NOT EVEN A CUBPILOTS SELFCONCEIT
STILL A DETECTABLE COMPLEMENT AND PRECIOUS

NATURALLY IT FLATTERED ME INTO BEING MORE LOYAL TO SHAKESPEAREIF
POSSIBLETHAN I WAS BEFORE AND MORE PREJUDICED AGAINST BACONIF
POSSIBLETHAN I WAS BEFORE AND SO WE DISCUSSED AND DISCUSSED BOTH ON
THE SAME SIDE AND WERE HAPPY FOR A WHILE ONLY FOR A WHILE ONLY FOR
A VERY LITTLE WHILE A VERY VERY VERY LITTLE WHILE THEN THE
ATMOSPHERE BEGAN TO CHANGE BEGAN TO COOL OFF

A BRIGHTER PERSON WOULD HAVE SEEN WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS EARLIER THAN I
DID PERHAPS BUT I SAW IT EARLY ENOUGH FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES YOU
SEE HE WAS OF AN ARGUMENTATIVE DISPOSITION THEREFORE IT TOOK HIM BUT
A LITTLE TIME TO GET TIRED OF ARGUING WITH A PERSON WHO AGREED WITH
EVERYTHING HE SAID AND CONSEQUENTLY NEVER FURNISHED HIM A PROVOCATIVE
TO FLARE UP AND SHOW WHAT HE COULD DO WHEN IT CAME TO CLEAR COLD
HARD ROSECUT HUNDREDFACETED DIAMONDFLASHING REASONING THAT WAS
HIS NAME FOR IT IT HAS BEEN APPLIED SINCE WITH COMPLACENCY AS MANY
AS SEVERAL TIMES IN THE BACONSHAKESPEARE SCUFFLE ON THE SHAKESPEARE
SIDE

THEN THE THING HAPPENED WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO MORE PERSONS THAN TO ME
WHEN PRINCIPLE AND PERSONAL INTEREST FOUND THEMSELVES IN OPPOSITION TO
EACH OTHER AND A CHOICE HAD TO BE MADE I LET PRINCIPLE GO AND WENT
OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE NOT THE ENTIRE WAY BUT FAR ENOUGH TO ANSWER
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CASE THAT IS TO SAY I TOOK THIS ATTITUDETO
WIT I ONLY BELIEVED BACON WROTE SHAKESPEARE WHEREAS I KNEW
SHAKESPEARE DIDNT EALER WAS SATISFIED WITH THAT AND THE WAR BROKE
LOOSE STUDY PRACTICE EXPERIENCE IN HANDLING MY END OF THE MATTER
PRESENTLY ENABLED ME TO TAKE MY NEW POSITION ALMOST SERIOUSLY A LITTLE
BIT LATER UTTERLY SERIOUSLY A LITTLE LATER STILL LOVINGLY
GRATEFULLY DEVOTEDLY FINALLY FIERCELY RABIDLY UNCOMPROMISINGLY
AFTER THAT I WAS WELDED TO MY FAITH I WAS THEORETICALLY READY TO DIE
FOR IT AND I LOOKED DOWN WITH COMPASSION NOT UNMIXED WITH SCORN UPON
EVERYBODY ELSES FAITH THAT DIDNT TALLY WITH MINE THAT FAITH IMPOSED
UPON ME BY SELFINTEREST IN THAT ANCIENT DAY REMAINS MY FAITH TODAY
AND IN IT I FIND COMFORT SOLACE PEACE AND NEVERFAILING JOY YOU SEE
HOW CURIOUSLY THEOLOGICAL IT IS THE RICE CHRISTIAN OF THE ORIENT
GOES THROUGH THE VERY SAME STEPS WHEN HE IS AFTER RICE AND THE
MISSIONARY IS AFTER HIM HE GOES FOR RICE AND REMAINS TO WORSHIP

EALER DID A LOT OF OUR REASONINGNOT TO SAY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF IT
THE SLAVES OF HIS CULT HAVE A PASSION FOR CALLING IT BY THAT LARGE
NAME WE OTHERS DO NOT CALL OUR INDUCTIONS AND DEDUCTIONS AND
REDUCTIONS BY ANY NAME AT ALL THEY SHOW FOR THEMSELVES WHAT THEY ARE
AND WE CAN WITH TRANQUIL CONFIDENCE LEAVE THE WORLD TO ENNOBLE THEM
WITH A TITLE OF ITS OWN CHOOSING

NOW AND THEN WHEN EALER HAD TO STOP TO COUGH I PULLED MY
INDUCTIONTALENTS TOGETHER AND HOVE THE CONTROVERSIAL LEAD MYSELF
ALWAYS GETTING EIGHT FEET EIGHT AND A HALF OFTEN NINE SOMETIMES EVEN
QUARTERLESSTWAINAS I BELIEVED BUT ALWAYS NO BOTTOM AS HE
SAID

I GOT THE BEST OF HIM ONLY ONCE I PREPARED MYSELF I WROTE OUT A
PASSAGE FROM SHAKESPEAREIT MAY HAVE BEEN THE VERY ONE I QUOTED AWHILE
AGO I DONT REMEMBERAND RIDDLED IT WITH HIS WILD STEAMBOATFUL
INTERLARDINGS WHEN AN UNRISKY OPPORTUNITY OFFERED ONE LOVELY SUMMER
DAY WHEN WE HAD SOUNDED AND BUOYED A TANGLED PATCH OF CROSSINGS KNOWN
AS HELLS HALF ACRE AND WERE ABOARD AGAIN AND HE HAD SNEAKED THE
PENNSYLVANIA TRIUMPHANTLY THROUGH IT WITHOUT ONCE SCRAPING SAND AND
THE A T LACEY HAD FOLLOWED IN OUR WAKE AND GOT STUCK AND HE WAS
FEELING GOOD I SHOWED IT TO HIM IT AMUSED HIM I ASKED HIM TO FIRE IT
OFFREAD IT READ IT I DIPLOMATICALLY ADDED AS ONLY HE COULD READ
DRAMATIC POETRY THE COMPLIMENT TOUCHED HIM WHERE HE LIVED HE DID READ
IT READ IT WITH SURPASSING FIRE AND SPIRIT READ IT AS IT WILL NEVER
BE READ AGAIN FOR HE KNEW HOW TO PUT THE RIGHT MUSIC INTO THOSE
THUNDEROUS INTERLARDINGS AND MAKE THEM SEEM A PART OF THE TEXT MAKE
THEM SOUND AS IF THEY WERE BURSTING FROM SHAKESPEARES OWN SOUL EACH
ONE OF THEM A GOLDEN INSPIRATION AND NOT TO BE LEFT OUT WITHOUT DAMAGE
TO THE MASSED AND MAGNIFICENT WHOLE

I WAITED A WEEK TO LET THE INCIDENT FADE WAITED LONGER WAITED UNTIL
HE BROUGHT UP FOR REASONINGS AND VITUPERATION MY PET POSITION MY PET
ARGUMENT THE ONE WHICH I WAS FONDEST OF THE ONE WHICH I PRIZED FAR
ABOVE ALL OTHERS IN MY AMMUNITIONWAGONTO WIT THAT SHAKESPEARE
COULDNT HAVE WRITTEN SHAKESPEARES WORKS FOR THE REASON THAT THE MAN
WHO WROTE THEM WAS LIMITLESSLY FAMILIAR WITH THE LAWS AND THE
LAWCOURTS AND LAWPROCEEDINGS AND LAWYERTALK AND LAWYERWAYSAND
IF SHAKESPEARE WAS POSSESSED OF THE INFINITELY DIVIDED STARDUST THAT
CONSTITUTED THIS VAST WEALTH HOW DID HE GET IT AND WHERE AND
WHEN

FROM BOOKS

FROM BOOKS THAT WAS ALWAYS THE IDEA I ANSWERED AS MY READINGS OF THE
CHAMPIONS OF MY SIDE OF THE GREAT CONTROVERSY HAD TAUGHT ME TO ANSWER
THAT A MAN CANT HANDLE GLIBLY AND EASILY AND COMFORTABLY AND
SUCCESSFULLY THE ARGOT OF A TRADE AT WHICH HE HAS NOT PERSONALLY
SERVED HE WILL MAKE MISTAKES HE WILL NOT AND CANNOT GET THE
TRADEPHRASINGS PRECISELY AND EXACTLY RIGHT AND THE MOMENT HE DEPARTS
BY EVEN A SHADE FROM A COMMON TRADEFORM THE READER WHO HAS SERVED
THAT TRADE WILL KNOW THE WRITER HASNT EALER WOULD NOT BE CONVINCED
HE SAID A MAN COULD LEARN HOW TO CORRECTLY HANDLE THE SUBTLETIES AND
MYSTERIES AND FREEMASONRIES OF ANY TRADE BY CAREFUL READING AND
STUDYING BUT WHEN I GOT HIM TO READ AGAIN THE PASSAGE FROM SHAKESPEARE
WITH THE INTERLARDINGS HE PERCEIVED HIMSELF THAT BOOKS COULDNT
TEACH A STUDENT A BEWILDERING MULTITUDE OF PILOTPHRASES SO THOROUGHLY
AND PERFECTLY THAT HE COULD TALK THEM OFF IN BOOK AND PLAY OR
CONVERSATION AND MAKE NO MISTAKE THAT A PILOT WOULD NOT IMMEDIATELY
DISCOVER IT WAS A TRIUMPH FOR ME HE WAS SILENT AWHILE AND I KNEW
WHAT WAS HAPPENINGHE WAS LOSING HIS TEMPER AND I KNEW HE WOULD
PRESENTLY CLOSE THE SESSION WITH THE SAME OLD ARGUMENT THAT WAS ALWAYS
HIS STAY AND HIS SUPPORT IN TIME OF NEED THE SAME OLD ARGUMENT THE
ONE I COULDNT ANSWER BECAUSE I DASNTTHE ARGUMENT THAT I WAS AN ASS
AND BETTER SHUT UP HE DELIVERED IT AND I OBEYED

O DEAR HOW LONG AGO IT WASHOW PATHETICALLY LONG AGO AND HERE AM I
OLD FORSAKEN FORLORN AND ALONE ARRANGING TO GET THAT ARGUMENT OUT
OF SOMEBODY AGAIN

WHEN A MAN HAS A PASSION FOR SHAKESPEARE IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT
HE KEEPS COMPANY WITH OTHER STANDARD AUTHORS EALER ALWAYS HAD SEVERAL
HIGHCLASS BOOKS IN THE PILOTHOUSE AND HE READ THE SAME ONES OVER AND
OVER AGAIN AND DID NOT CARE TO CHANGE TO NEWER AND FRESHER ONES HE
PLAYED WELL ON THE FLUTE AND GREATLY ENJOYED HEARING HIMSELF PLAY SO
DID I HE HAD A NOTION THAT A FLUTE WOULD KEEP ITS HEALTH BETTER IF YOU
TOOK IT APART WHEN IT WAS NOT STANDING A WATCH AND SO WHEN IT WAS NOT
ON DUTY IT TOOK ITS REST DISJOINTED ON THE COMPASSSHELF UNDER THE
BREASTBOARD WHEN THE PENNSYLVANIA BLEW UP AND BECAME A DRIFTING
RACKHEAP FREIGHTED WITH WOUNDED AND DYING POOR SOULS MY YOUNG BROTHER
HENRY AMONG THEM PILOT BROWN HAD THE WATCH BELOW AND WAS PROBABLY
ASLEEP AND NEVER KNEW WHAT KILLED HIM BUT EALER ESCAPED UNHURT HE AND
HIS PILOTHOUSE WERE SHOT UP INTO THE AIR THEN THEY FELL AND EALER
SANK THROUGH THE RAGGED CAVERN WHERE THE HURRICANEDECK AND THE
BOILERDECK HAD BEEN AND LANDED IN A NEST OF RUINS ON THE MAIN DECK
ON TOP OF ONE OF THE UNEXPLODED BOILERS WHERE HE LAY PRONE IN A FOG OF
SCALD AND DEADLY STEAM BUT NOT FOR LONG HE DID NOT LOSE HIS HEADLONG
FAMILIARITY WITH DANGER HAD TAUGHT HIM TO KEEP IT IN ANY AND ALL
EMERGENCIES HE HELD HIS COATLAPELS TO HIS NOSE WITH ONE HAND TO KEEP
OUT THE STEAM AND SCRABBLED AROUND WITH THE OTHER TILL HE FOUND THE
JOINTS OF HIS FLUTE THEN HE TOOK MEASURES TO SAVE HIMSELF ALIVE AND
WAS SUCCESSFUL I WAS NOT ON BOARD I HAD BEEN PUT ASHORE IN NEW
ORLEANS BY CAPTAIN KLINEFELTER THE REASONHOWEVER I HAVE TOLD ALL
ABOUT IT IN THE BOOK CALLED OLD TIMES ON THE MISSISSIPPI AND IT
ISNT IMPORTANT ANYWAY IT IS SO LONG AGO

II

WHEN I WAS A SUNDAYSCHOOL SCHOLAR SOMETHING MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS
AGO I BECAME INTERESTED IN SATAN AND WANTED TO FIND OUT ALL I COULD
ABOUT HIM I BEGAN TO ASK QUESTIONS BUT MY CLASSTEACHER MR BARCLAY
THE STONEMASON WAS RELUCTANT ABOUT ANSWERING THEM IT SEEMED TO ME I
WAS ANXIOUS TO BE PRAISED FOR TURNING MY THOUGHTS TO SERIOUS SUBJECTS
WHEN THERE WASNT ANOTHER BOY IN THE VILLAGE WHO COULD BE HIRED TO DO
SUCH A THING I WAS GREATLY INTERESTED IN THE INCIDENT OF EVE AND THE
SERPENT AND THOUGHT EVES CALMNESS WAS PERFECTLY NOBLE I ASKED MR
BARCLAY IF HE HAD EVER HEARD OF ANOTHER WOMAN WHO BEING APPROACHED BY
A SERPENT WOULD NOT EXCUSE HERSELF AND BREAK FOR THE NEAREST TIMBER
HE DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION BUT REBUKED ME FOR INQUIRING INTO
MATTERS ABOVE MY AGE AND COMPREHENSION I WILL SAY FOR MR BARCLAY THAT
HE WAS WILLING TO TELL ME THE FACTS OF SATANS HISTORY BUT HE STOPPED
THERE HE WOULDNT ALLOW ANY DISCUSSION OF THEM

IN THE COURSE OF TIME WE EXHAUSTED THE FACTS THERE WERE ONLY FIVE OR
SIX OF THEM YOU COULD SET THEM ALL DOWN ON A VISITINGCARD I WAS
DISAPPOINTED I HAD BEEN MEDITATING A BIOGRAPHY AND WAS GRIEVED TO
FIND THAT THERE WERE NO MATERIALS I SAID AS MUCH WITH THE TEARS
RUNNING DOWN MR BARCLAYS SYMPATHY AND COMPASSION WERE AROUSED FOR
HE WAS A MOST KIND AND GENTLESPIRITED MAN AND HE PATTED ME ON THE
HEAD AND CHEERED ME UP BY SAYING THERE WAS A WHOLE VAST OCEAN OF
MATERIALS I CAN STILL FEEL THE HAPPY THRILL WHICH THESE BLESSED WORDS
SHOT THROUGH ME

THEN HE BEGAN TO BAIL OUT THAT OCEANS RICHES FOR MY ENCOURAGEMENT AND
JOY LIKE THIS IT WAS CONJECTUREDTHOUGH NOT ESTABLISHEDTHAT SATAN
WAS ORIGINALLY AN ANGEL IN HEAVEN THAT HE FELL THAT HE REBELLED AND
BROUGHT ON A WAR THAT HE WAS DEFEATED AND BANISHED TO PERDITION
ALSO WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT LATER HE DID SO AND SO THAT WE
ARE WARRANTED IN SUPPOSING THAT AT A SUBSEQUENT TIME HE TRAVELED
EXTENSIVELY SEEKING WHOM HE MIGHT DEVOUR THAT A COUPLE OF CENTURIES
AFTERWARD AS TRADITION INSTRUCTS US HE TOOK UP THE CRUEL TRADE OF
TEMPTING PEOPLE TO THEIR RUIN WITH VAST AND FEARFUL RESULTS THAT BY
AND BY AS THE PROBABILITIES SEEM TO INDICATE HE MAY HAVE DONE
CERTAIN THINGS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE CERTAIN OTHER THINGS HE MUST HAVE
DONE STILL OTHER THINGS

AND SO ON AND SO ON WE SET DOWN THE FIVE KNOWN FACTS BY THEMSELVES ON
A PIECE OF PAPER AND NUMBERED IT PAGE THEN ON FIFTEEN HUNDRED
OTHER PIECES OF PAPER WE SET DOWN THE CONJECTURES AND
SUPPOSITIONS AND MAYBES AND PERHAPSES AND DOUBTLESSES AND
RUMORS AND GUESSES AND PROBABILITIES AND LIKELIHOODS AND
WE ARE PERMITTED TO THINKS AND WE ARE WARRANTED IN BELIEVINGS AND
MIGHT HAVE BEENS AND COULD HAVE BEENS AND MUST HAVE BEENS AND
UNQUESTIONABLYS AND WITHOUT A SHADOW OF DOUBTSAND BEHOLD

MATERIALS WHY WE HAD ENOUGH TO BUILD A BIOGRAPHY OF SHAKESPEARE

YET HE MADE ME PUT AWAY MY PEN HE WOULD NOT LET ME WRITE THE HISTORY
OF SATAN WHY BECAUSE AS HE SAID HE HAD SUSPICIONSSUSPICIONS THAT
MY ATTITUDE IN THAT MATTER WAS NOT REVERENT AND THAT A PERSON MUST BE
REVERENT WHEN WRITING ABOUT THE SACRED CHARACTERS HE SAID ANY ONE WHO
SPOKE FLIPPANTLY OF SATAN WOULD BE FROWNED UPON BY THE RELIGIOUS WORLD
AND ALSO BE BROUGHT TO ACCOUNT

I ASSURED HIM IN EARNEST AND SINCERE WORDS THAT HE HAD WHOLLY
MISCONCEIVED MY ATTITUDE THAT I HAD THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR SATAN AND
THAT MY REVERENCE FOR HIM EQUALED AND POSSIBLY EVEN EXCEEDED THAT OF
ANY MEMBER OF ANY CHURCH I SAID IT WOUNDED ME DEEPLY TO PERCEIVE BY
HIS WORDS THAT HE THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE FUN OF SATAN AND DERIDE HIM
LAUGH AT HIM SCOFF AT HIM WHEREAS IN TRUTH I HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF
SUCH A THING BUT HAD ONLY A WARM DESIRE TO MAKE FUN OF THOSE OTHERS
AND LAUGH AT THEM WHAT OTHERS WHY THE SUPPOSERS THE
PERHAPSERS THE MIGHTHAVEBEENERS THE COULDHAVEBEENERS THE
MUSTHAVEBEENERS THE WITHOUTASHADOWOFDOUBTERS THE
WEAREWARRANTEDINBELIEVINGERS AND ALL THAT FUNNY CROP OF SOLEMN
ARCHITECTS WHO HAVE TAKEN A GOOD SOLID FOUNDATION OF FIVE INDISPUTABLE
AND UNIMPORTANT FACTS AND BUILT UPON IT A CONJECTURAL SATAN THIRTY
MILES HIGH

WHAT DID MR BARCLAY DO THEN WAS HE DISARMED WAS HE SILENCED NO HE
WAS SHOCKED HE WAS SO SHOCKED THAT HE VISIBLY SHUDDERED HE SAID THE
SATANIC TRADITIONERS AND PERHAPSERS AND CONJECTURERS WERE THEMSELVES
SACRED AS SACRED AS THEIR WORK SO SACRED THAT WHOSO VENTURED TO MOCK
THEM OR MAKE FUN OF THEIR WORK COULD NOT AFTERWARD ENTER ANY
RESPECTABLE HOUSE EVEN BY THE BACK DOOR

HOW TRUE WERE HIS WORDS AND HOW WISE HOW FORTUNATE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
FOR ME IF I HAD HEEDED THEM BUT I WAS YOUNG I WAS BUT SEVEN YEARS OF
AGE AND VAIN FOOLISH AND ANXIOUS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION I WROTE THE
BIOGRAPHY AND HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A RESPECTABLE HOUSE SINCE

III

HOW CURIOUS AND INTERESTING IS THE PARALLELAS FAR AS POVERTY OF
BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS IS CONCERNEDBETWEEN SATAN AND SHAKESPEARE IT IS
WONDERFUL IT IS UNIQUE IT STANDS QUITE ALONE THERE IS NOTHING
RESEMBLING IT IN HISTORY NOTHING RESEMBLING IT IN ROMANCE NOTHING
APPROACHING IT EVEN IN TRADITION HOW SUBLIME IS THEIR POSITION AND
HOW OVERTOPPING HOW SKYREACHING HOW SUPREMETHE TWO GREAT UNKNOWNS
THE TWO ILLUSTRIOUS CONJECTURABILITIES THEY ARE THE BESTKNOWN UNKNOWN
PERSONS THAT HAVE EVER DRAWN BREATH UPON THE PLANET

FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF THE IGNORANT I WILL MAKE A LIST NOW OF THOSE
DETAILS OF SHAKESPEARES HISTORY WHICH ARE FACTSVERIFIED FACTS
ESTABLISHED FACTS UNDISPUTED FACTS

FACTS

HE WAS BORN ON THE D OF APRIL

OF GOOD FARMERCLASS PARENTS WHO COULD NOT READ COULD NOT WRITE COULD
NOT SIGN THEIR NAMES

AT STRATFORD A SMALL BACK SETTLEMENT WHICH IN THAT DAY WAS SHABBY AND
UNCLEAN AND DENSELY ILLITERATE OF THE NINETEEN IMPORTANT MEN CHARGED
WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE TOWN THIRTEEN HAD TO MAKE THEIR MARK IN
ATTESTING IMPORTANT DOCUMENTS BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT WRITE THEIR
NAMES

OF THE FIRST EIGHTEEN YEARS OF HIS LIFE NOTHING IS KNOWN THEY ARE A
BLANK

ON THE TH OF NOVEMBER WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE TOOK OUT A LICENSE
TO MARRY ANNE WHATELEY

NEXT DAY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE TOOK OUT A LICENSE TO MARRY ANNE HATHAWAY
SHE WAS EIGHT YEARS HIS SENIOR

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE MARRIED ANNE HATHAWAY IN A HURRY BY GRACE OF A
RELUCTANTLY GRANTED DISPENSATION THERE WAS BUT ONE PUBLICATION OF THE
BANNS

WITHIN SIX MONTHS THE FIRST CHILD WAS BORN

ABOUT TWO BLANK YEARS FOLLOWED DURING WHICH PERIOD NOTHING AT ALL
HAPPENED TO SHAKESPEARE SO FAR AS ANYBODY KNOWS

THEN CAME TWINS FEBRUARY

TWO BLANK YEARS FOLLOW

THENHE MAKES A TENYEAR VISIT TO LONDON LEAVING THE FAMILY
BEHIND

FIVE BLANK YEARS FOLLOW DURING THIS PERIOD NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM
AS FAR AS ANYBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS

THENTHERE IS MENTION OF HIM AS AN ACTOR

NEXT YEARHIS NAME APPEARS IN THE OFFICIAL LIST OF PLAYERS

NEXT YEARHE PLAYED BEFORE THE QUEEN A DETAIL OF NO CONSEQUENCE
OTHER OBSCURITIES DID IT EVERY YEAR OF THE FORTYFIVE OF HER REIGN AND
REMAINED OBSCURE

THREE PRETTY FULL YEARS FOLLOW FULL OF PLAYACTING THEN

IN HE BOUGHT NEW PLACE STRATFORD

THIRTEEN OR FOURTEEN BUSY YEARS FOLLOW YEARS IN WHICH HE ACCUMULATED
MONEY AND ALSO REPUTATION AS ACTOR AND MANAGER

MEANTIME HIS NAME LIBERALLY AND VARIOUSLY SPELT HAD BECOME ASSOCIATED
WITH A NUMBER OF GREAT PLAYS AND POEMS AS OSTENSIBLY AUTHOR OF THE
SAME

SOME OF THESE IN THESE YEARS AND LATER WERE PIRATED BUT HE MADE NO
PROTEST

THENHE RETURNED TO STRATFORD AND SETTLED DOWN FOR GOOD AND
ALL AND BUSIED HIMSELF IN LENDING MONEY TRADING IN TITHES TRADING IN
LAND AND HOUSES SHIRKING A DEBT OF FORTYONE SHILLINGS BORROWED BY
HIS WIFE DURING HIS LONG DESERTION OF HIS FAMILY SUING DEBTORS FOR
SHILLINGS AND COPPERS BEING SUED HIMSELF FOR SHILLINGS AND COPPERS
AND ACTING AS CONFEDERATE TO A NEIGHBOR WHO TRIED TO ROB THE TOWN OF
ITS RIGHTS IN A CERTAIN COMMON AND DID NOT SUCCEED

HE LIVED FIVE OR SIX YEARSTILL IN THE JOY OF THESE ELEVATED
PURSUITS THEN HE MADE A WILL AND SIGNED EACH OF ITS THREE PAGES WITH
HIS NAME

A THOROUGHGOING BUSINESS MANS WILL IT NAMED IN MINUTE DETAIL EVERY
ITEM OF PROPERTY HE OWNED IN THE WORLDHOUSES LANDS SWORD
SILVERGILT BOWL AND SO ONALL THE WAY DOWN TO HIS SECONDBEST BED
AND ITS FURNITURE

IT CAREFULLY AND CALCULATINGLY DISTRIBUTED HIS RICHES AMONG THE MEMBERS
OF HIS FAMILY OVERLOOKING NO INDIVIDUAL OF IT NOT EVEN HIS WIFE THE
WIFE HE HAD BEEN ENABLED TO MARRY IN A HURRY BY URGENT GRACE OF A
SPECIAL DISPENSATION BEFORE HE WAS NINETEEN THE WIFE WHOM HE HAD LEFT
HUSBANDLESS SO MANY YEARS THE WIFE WHO HAD HAD TO BORROW FORTYONE
SHILLINGS IN HER NEED AND WHICH THE LENDER WAS NEVER ABLE TO COLLECT
OF THE PROSPEROUS HUSBAND BUT DIED AT LAST WITH THE MONEY STILL
LACKING NO EVEN THIS WIFE WAS REMEMBERED IN SHAKESPEARES WILL

HE LEFT HER THAT SECONDBEST BED

AND NOT ANOTHER THING NOT EVEN A PENNY TO BLESS HER LUCKY WIDOWHOOD
WITH

IT WAS EMINENTLY AND CONSPICUOUSLY A BUSINESS MANS WILL NOT A POETS

IT MENTIONED NOT A SINGLE BOOK

BOOKS WERE MUCH MORE PRECIOUS THAN SWORDS AND SILVERGILT BOWLS AND
SECONDBEST BEDS IN THOSE DAYS AND WHEN A DEPARTING PERSON OWNED ONE
HE GAVE IT A HIGH PLACE IN HIS WILL

THE WILL MENTIONED NOT A PLAY NOT A POEM NOT AN UNFINISHED LITERARY
WORK NOT A SCRAP OF MANUSCRIPT OF ANY KIND

MANY POETS HAVE DIED POOR BUT THIS IS THE ONLY ONE IN HISTORY THAT HAS
DIED THIS POOR THE OTHERS ALL LEFT LITERARY REMAINS BEHIND ALSO A
BOOK MAYBE TWO

IF SHAKESPEARE HAD OWNED A DOGBUT WE NEED NOT GO INTO THAT WE KNOW HE
WOULD HAVE MENTIONED IT IN HIS WILL IF A GOOD DOG SUSANNA WOULD HAVE
GOT IT IF AN INFERIOR ONE HIS WIFE WOULD HAVE GOT A DOWER INTEREST IN
IT I WISH HE HAD HAD A DOG JUST SO WE COULD SEE HOW PAINSTAKINGLY HE
WOULD HAVE DIVIDED THAT DOG AMONG THE FAMILY IN HIS CAREFUL BUSINESS
WAY

HE SIGNED THE WILL IN THREE PLACES

IN EARLIER YEARS HE SIGNED TWO OTHER OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS

THESE FIVE SIGNATURES STILL EXIST

THERE ARE NO OTHER SPECIMENS OF HIS PENMANSHIP IN EXISTENCE NOT A
LINE

WAS HE PREJUDICED AGAINST THE ART HIS GRANDDAUGHTER WHOM HE LOVED
WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD WHEN HE DIED YET SHE HAD HAD NO TEACHING HE LEFT
NO PROVISION FOR HER EDUCATION ALTHOUGH HE WAS RICH AND IN HER MATURE
WOMANHOOD SHE COULDNT WRITE AND COULDNT TELL HER HUSBANDS MANUSCRIPT
FROM ANYBODY ELSESSHE THOUGHT IT WAS SHAKESPEARES

WHEN SHAKESPEARE DIED IN STRATFORD IT WAS NOT AN EVENT IT MADE NO
MORE STIR IN ENGLAND THAN THE DEATH OF ANY OTHER FORGOTTEN
THEATERACTOR WOULD HAVE MADE NOBODY CAME DOWN FROM LONDON THERE WERE
NO LAMENTING POEMS NO EULOGIES NO NATIONAL TEARSTHERE WAS MERELY
SILENCE AND NOTHING MORE A STRIKING CONTRAST WITH WHAT HAPPENED WHEN
BEN JONSON AND FRANCIS BACON AND SPENSER AND RALEIGH AND THE OTHER
DISTINGUISHED LITERARY FOLK OF SHAKESPEARES TIME PASSED FROM LIFE NO
PRAISEFUL VOICE WAS LIFTED FOR THE LOST BARD OF AVON EVEN BEN JONSON
WAITED SEVEN YEARS BEFORE HE LIFTED HIS

SO FAR AS ANYBODY ACTUALLY KNOWS AND CAN PROVE SHAKESPEARE OF
STRATFORDONAVON NEVER WROTE A PLAY IN HIS LIFE

SO FAR AS ANYBODY KNOWS AND CAN PROVE HE NEVER WROTE A LETTER TO
ANYBODY IN HIS LIFE

SO FAR AS ANY ONE KNOWS HE RECEIVED ONLY ONE LETTER DURING HIS LIFE

SO FAR AS ANY ONE KNOWS AND CAN PROVE SHAKESPEARE OF STRATFORD WROTE
ONLY ONE POEM DURING HIS LIFE THIS ONE IS AUTHENTIC HE DID WRITE THAT
ONEA FACT WHICH STANDS UNDISPUTED HE WROTE THE WHOLE OF IT HE WROTE
THE WHOLE OF IT OUT OF HIS OWN HEAD HE COMMANDED THAT THIS WORK OF ART
BE ENGRAVED UPON HIS TOMB AND HE WAS OBEYED THERE IT ABIDES TO THIS
DAY THIS IS IT

GOOD FRIEND FOR IESUS SAKE FORBEARE
TO DIGG THE DUST ENCLOASED HEARE
BLEST BE YE MAN YT SPARES THES STONES
AND CURST BE HE YT MOVES MY BONES


IN THE LIST AS ABOVE SET DOWN WILL BE FOUND EVERY POSITIVELY KNOWN
FACT OF SHAKESPEARES LIFE LEAN AND MEAGER AS THE INVOICE IS BEYOND
THESE DETAILS WE KNOW NOT A THING ABOUT HIM ALL THE REST OF HIS VAST
HISTORY AS FURNISHED BY THE BIOGRAPHERS IS BUILT UP COURSE UPON
COURSE OF GUESSES INFERENCES THEORIES CONJECTURESAN EIFFEL TOWER
OF ARTIFICIALITIES RISING SKYHIGH FROM A VERY FLAT AND VERY THIN
FOUNDATION OF INCONSEQUENTIAL FACTS

IV

CONJECTURES

THE HISTORIANS SUPPOSE THAT SHAKESPEARE ATTENDED THE FREE SCHOOL IN
STRATFORD FROM THE TIME HE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD TILL HE WAS THIRTEEN
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE IN EXISTENCE THAT HE EVER WENT TO SCHOOL AT ALL

THE HISTORIANS INFER THAT HE GOT HIS LATIN IN THAT SCHOOLTHE SCHOOL
WHICH THEY SUPPOSE HE ATTENDED

THEY SUPPOSE HIS FATHERS DECLINING FORTUNES MADE IT NECESSARY FOR
HIM TO LEAVE THE SCHOOL THEY SUPPOSED HE ATTENDED AND GET TO WORK AND
HELP SUPPORT HIS PARENTS AND THEIR TEN CHILDREN BUT THERE IS NO
EVIDENCE THAT HE EVER ENTERED OR RETURNED FROM THE SCHOOL THEY SUPPOSE
HE ATTENDED

THEY SUPPOSE HE ASSISTED HIS FATHER IN THE BUTCHERING BUSINESS AND
THAT BEING ONLY A BOY HE DIDNT HAVE TO DO FULLGROWN BUTCHERING BUT
ONLY SLAUGHTERED CALVES ALSO THAT WHENEVER HE KILLED A CALF HE MADE A
HIGHFLOWN SPEECH OVER IT THIS SUPPOSITION RESTS UPON THE TESTIMONY OF
A MAN WHO WASNT THERE AT THE TIME A MAN WHO GOT IT FROM A MAN WHO
COULD HAVE BEEN THERE BUT DID NOT SAY WHETHER HE WAS NOR NOT AND
NEITHER OF THEM THOUGHT TO MENTION IT FOR DECADES AND DECADES AND
DECADES AND TWO MORE DECADES AFTER SHAKESPEARES DEATH UNTIL OLD AGE
AND MENTAL DECAY HAD REFRESHED AND VIVIFIED THEIR MEMORIES THEY
HADNT TWO FACTS IN STOCK ABOUT THE LONGDEAD DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
BUT ONLY JUST THE ONE HE SLAUGHTERED CALVES AND BROKE INTO ORATORY
WHILE HE WAS AT IT CURIOUS THEY HAD ONLY ONE FACT YET THE
DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN HAD SPENT TWENTYSIX YEARS IN THAT LITTLE
TOWNJUST HALF HIS LIFETIME HOWEVER RIGHTLY VIEWED IT WAS THE MOST
IMPORTANT FACT INDEED ALMOST THE ONLY IMPORTANT FACT OF SHAKESPEARES
LIFE IN STRATFORD RIGHTLY VIEWED FOR EXPERIENCE IS AN AUTHORS MOST
VALUABLE ASSET EXPERIENCE IS THE THING THAT PUTS THE MUSCLE AND THE
BREATH AND THE WARM BLOOD INTO THE BOOK HE WRITES RIGHTLY VIEWED
CALFBUTCHERING ACCOUNTS FOR TITUS ANDRONICUS THE ONLY PLAYAINT
ITTHAT THE STRATFORD SHAKESPEARE EVER WROTE AND YET IT IS THE ONLY
ONE EVERYBODY TRIED TO CHOUSE HIM OUT OF THE BACONIANS INCLUDED

THE HISTORIANS FIND THEMSELVES JUSTIFIED IN BELIEVING THAT THE YOUNG
SHAKESPEARE POACHED UPON SIR THOMAS LUCYS DEER PRESERVES AND GOT HALED
BEFORE THAT MAGISTRATE FOR IT BUT THERE IS NO SHRED OF RESPECTWORTHY
EVIDENCE THAT ANYTHING OF THE KIND HAPPENED

THE HISTORIANS HAVING ARGUED THE THING THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED INTO
THE THING THAT DID HAPPEN FOUND NO TROUBLE IN TURNING SIR THOMAS
LUCY INTO MR JUSTICE SHALLOW THEY HAVE LONG AGO CONVINCED THE
WORLDON SURMISE AND WITHOUT TRUSTWORTHY EVIDENCETHAT SHALLOW IS SIR
THOMAS

THE NEXT ADDITION TO THE YOUNG SHAKESPEARES STRATFORD HISTORY COMES
EASY THE HISTORIAN BUILDS IT OUT OF THE SURMISED DEERSTEELING AND
THE SURMISED TRIAL BEFORE THE MAGISTRATE AND THE SURMISED
VENGEANCEPROMPTED SATIRE UPON THE MAGISTRATE IN THE PLAY RESULT THE
YOUNG SHAKESPEARE WAS A WILD WILD WILD OH SUCH A WILD YOUNG
SCAMP AND THAT GRATUITOUS SLANDER IS ESTABLISHED FOR ALL TIME IT IS
THE VERY WAY PROFESSOR OSBORN AND I BUILT THE COLOSSAL SKELETON
BRONTOSAUR THAT STANDS FIFTYSEVEN FEET LONG AND SIXTEEN FEET HIGH IN
THE NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM THE AWE AND ADMIRATION OF ALL THE WORLD
THE STATELIEST SKELETON THAT EXISTS ON THE PLANET WE HAD NINE BONES
AND WE BUILT THE REST OF HIM OUT OF PLASTER OF PARIS WE RAN SHORT OF
PLASTER OF PARIS OR WED HAVE BUILT A BRONTOSAUR THAT COULD SIT DOWN
BESIDE THE STRATFORD SHAKESPEARE AND NONE BUT AN EXPERT COULD TELL
WHICH WAS BIGGEST OR CONTAINED THE MOST PLASTER

SHAKESPEARE PRONOUNCED VENUS AND ADONIS THE FIRST HEIR OF HIS
INVENTION APPARENTLY IMPLYING THAT IT WAS HIS FIRST EFFORT AT
LITERARY COMPOSITION HE SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID IT IT HAS BEEN AN
EMBARRASSMENT TO HIS HISTORIANS THESE MANY MANY YEARS THEY HAVE TO
MAKE HIM WRITE THAT GRACEFUL AND POLISHED AND FLAWLESS AND BEAUTIFUL
POEM BEFORE HE ESCAPED FROM STRATFORD AND HIS FAMILY OR AGE
TWENTYTWO OR ALONG THERE BECAUSE WITHIN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS HE WROTE
FIVE GREAT PLAYS AND COULD NOT HAVE FOUND TIME TO WRITE ANOTHER LINE

IT IS SORELY EMBARRASSING IF HE BEGAN TO SLAUGHTER CALVES AND POACH
DEER AND ROLLICK AROUND AND LEARN ENGLISH AT THE EARLIEST LIKELY
MOMENTSAY AT THIRTEEN WHEN HE WAS SUPPOSABLY WRENCHED FROM THAT
SCHOOL WHERE HE WAS SUPPOSABLY STORING UP LATIN FOR FUTURE LITERARY
USEHE HAD HIS YOUTHFUL HANDS FULL AND MUCH MORE THAN FULL HE MUST
HAVE HAD TO PUT ASIDE HIS WARWICKSHIRE DIALECT WHICH WOULDNT BE
UNDERSTOOD IN LONDON AND STUDY ENGLISH VERY HARD VERY HARD INDEED
INCREDIBLY HARD ALMOST IF THE RESULT OF THAT LABOR WAS TO BE THE
SMOOTH AND ROUNDED AND FLEXIBLE AND LETTERPERFECT ENGLISH OF THE
VENUS AND ADONIS IN THE SPACE OF TEN YEARS AND AT THE SAME TIME
LEARN GREAT AND FINE AND UNSURPASSABLE LITERARY FORM

HOWEVER IT IS CONJECTURED THAT HE ACCOMPLISHED ALL THIS AND MORE
MUCH MORE LEARNED LAW AND ITS INTRICACIES AND THE COMPLEX PROCEDURE
OF THE LAWCOURTS AND ALL ABOUT SOLDIERING AND SAILORING AND THE
MANNERS AND CUSTOMS AND WAYS OF ROYAL COURTS AND ARISTOCRATIC SOCIETY
AND LIKEWISE ACCUMULATED IN HIS ONE HEAD EVERY KIND OF KNOWLEDGE THE
LEARNED THEN POSSESSED AND EVERY KIND OF HUMBLE KNOWLEDGE POSSESSED BY
THE LOWLY AND THE IGNORANT AND ADDED THERETO A WIDER AND MORE INTIMATE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE WORLDS GREAT LITERATURES ANCIENT AND MODERN THAN
WAS POSSESSED BY ANY OTHER MAN OF HIS TIMEFOR HE WAS GOING TO MAKE
BRILLIANT AND EASY AND ADMIRATIONCOMPELLING USE OF THESE SPLENDID
TREASURES THE MOMENT HE GOT TO LONDON AND ACCORDING TO THE SURMISERS
THAT IS WHAT HE DID YES ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO ONE IN STRATFORD ABLE
TO TEACH HIM THESE THINGS AND NO LIBRARY IN THE LITTLE VILLAGE TO DIG
THEM OUT OF HIS FATHER COULD NOT READ AND EVEN THE SURMISERS SURMISE
THAT HE DID NOT KEEP A LIBRARY

IT IS SURMISED BY THE BIOGRAPHERS THAT THE YOUNG SHAKESPEARE GOT HIS
VAST KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW AND HIS FAMILIAR AND ACCURATE ACQUAINTANCE
WITH THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS AND SHOPTALK OF LAWYERS THROUGH BEING FOR
A TIME THE CLERK OF A STRATFORD COURT JUST AS A BRIGHT LAD LIKE ME
REARED IN A VILLAGE ON THE BANKS OF THE MISSISSIPPI MIGHT BECOME
PERFECT IN KNOWLEDGE OF THE BERING STRAIT WHALEFISHERY AND THE
SHOPTALK OF THE VETERAN EXERCISES OF THAT ADVENTUREBRISTLING TRADE
THROUGH CATCHING CATFISH WITH A TROTLINE SUNDAYS BUT THE SURMISE IS
DAMAGED BY THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCEAND NOT EVEN
TRADITIONTHAT THE YOUNG SHAKESPEARE WAS EVER CLERK OF A LAWCOURT

IT IS FURTHER SURMISED THAT THE YOUNG SHAKESPEARE ACCUMULATED HIS
LAWTREASURES IN THE FIRST YEARS OF HIS SOJOURN IN LONDON THROUGH
AMUSING HIMSELF BY LEARNING BOOKLAW IN HIS GARRET AND BY PICKING UP
LAWYERTALK AND THE REST OF IT THROUGH LOITERING ABOUT THE LAWCOURTS
AND LISTENING BUT IT IS ONLY SURMISE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE
EVER DID EITHER OF THOSE THINGS THEY ARE MERELY A COUPLE OF CHUNKS OF
PLASTER OF PARIS

THERE IS A LEGEND THAT HE GOT HIS BREAD AND BUTTER BY HOLDING HORSES IN
FRONT OF THE LONDON THEATERS MORNINGS AND AFTERNOONS MAYBE HE DID IF
HE DID IT SERIOUSLY SHORTENED HIS LAWSTUDY HOURS AND HIS
RECREATIONTIME IN THE COURTS IN THOSE VERY DAYS HE WAS WRITING GREAT
PLAYS AND NEEDED ALL THE TIME HE COULD GET THE HORSEHOLDING LEGEND
OUGHT TO BE STRANGLED IT TOO FORMIDABLY INCREASES THE HISTORIANS
DIFFICULTY IN ACCOUNTING FOR THE YOUNG SHAKESPEARES ERUDITIONAN
ERUDITION WHICH HE WAS ACQUIRING HUNK BY HUNK AND CHUNK BY CHUNK
EVERY DAY IN THOSE STRENUOUS TIMES AND EMPTYING EACH DAYS CATCH INTO
NEXT DAYS IMPERISHABLE DRAMA

HE HAD TO ACQUIRE A KNOWLEDGE OF WAR AT THE SAME TIME AND A KNOWLEDGE
OF SOLDIERPEOPLE AND SAILORPEOPLE AND THEIR WAYS AND TALK ALSO A
KNOWLEDGE OF SOME FOREIGN LANDS AND THEIR LANGUAGES FOR HE WAS DAILY
EMPTYING FLUENT STREAMS OF THESE VARIOUS KNOWLEDGES TOO INTO HIS
DRAMAS HOW DID HE ACQUIRE THESE RICH ASSETS

IN THE USUAL WAY BY SURMISE IT IS SURMISED THAT HE TRAVELED IN
ITALY AND GERMANY AND AROUND AND QUALIFIED HIMSELF TO PUT THEIR SCENIC
AND SOCIAL ASPECTS UPON PAPER THAT HE PERFECTED HIMSELF IN FRENCH
ITALIAN AND SPANISH ON THE ROAD THAT HE WENT IN LEICESTERS
EXPEDITION TO THE LOW COUNTRIES AS SOLDIER OR SUTLER OR SOMETHING FOR
SEVERAL MONTHS OR YEARSOR WHATEVER LENGTH OF TIME A SURMISER NEEDS IN
HIS BUSINESSAND THUS BECAME FAMILIAR WITH SOLDIERSHIP AND SOLDIERWAYS
AND SOLDIERTALK AND GENERALSHIP AND GENERALWAYS AND GENERALTALK AND
SEAMANSHIP AND SAILORWAYS AND SAILORTALK

MAYBE HE DID ALL THESE THINGS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHO HELD THE
HORSES IN THE MEAN TIME AND WHO STUDIED THE BOOKS IN THE GARRET AND
WHO FROLICKED IN THE LAWCOURTS FOR RECREATION ALSO WHO DID THE
CALLBOYING AND THE PLAYACTING

FOR HE BECAME A CALLBOY AND AS EARLY AS HE BECAME A
VAGABONDTHE LAWS UNGENTLE TERM FOR AN UNLISTED ACTOR AND IN A
REGULAR AND PROPERLY AND OFFICIALLY LISTED MEMBER OF THAT IN THOSE
DAYS LIGHTLY VALUED AND NOT MUCH RESPECTED PROFESSION

RIGHT SOON THEREAFTER HE BECAME A STOCKHOLDER IN TWO THEATERS AND
MANAGER OF THEM THENCEFORWARD HE WAS A BUSY AND FLOURISHING BUSINESS
MAN AND WAS RAKING IN MONEY WITH BOTH HANDS FOR TWENTY YEARS THEN IN
A NOBLE FRENZY OF POETIC INSPIRATION HE WROTE HIS ONE POEMHIS ONLY
POEM HIS DARLINGAND LAID HIM DOWN AND DIED

GOOD FRIEND FOR IESUS SAKE FORBEARE
TO DIGG THE DUST ENCLOASED HEARE
BLEST BE YE MAN YT SPARES THES STONES
AND CURST BE HE YT MOVES MY BONES


HE WAS PROBABLY DEAD WHEN HE WROTE IT STILL THIS IS ONLY CONJECTURE
WE HAVE ONLY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE INTERNAL EVIDENCE

SHALL I SET DOWN THE REST OF THE CONJECTURES WHICH CONSTITUTE THE GIANT
BIOGRAPHY OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE IT WOULD STRAIN THE UNABRIDGED
DICTIONARY TO HOLD THEM HE IS A BRONTOSAUR NINE BONES AND SIX HUNDRED
BARRELS OF PLASTER OF PARIS

V

WE MAY ASSUME

IN THE ASSUMING TRADE THREE SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT CULTS ARE
TRANSACTING BUSINESS TWO OF THESE CULTS ARE KNOWN AS THE
SHAKESPEARITES AND THE BACONIANS AND I AM THE OTHER ONETHE
BRONTOSAURIAN

THE SHAKESPEARITE KNOWS THAT SHAKESPEARE WROTE SHAKESPEARES WORKS THE
BACONIAN KNOWS THAT FRANCIS BACON WROTE THEM THE BRONTOSAURIAN DOESNT
REALLY KNOW WHICH OF THEM DID IT BUT IS QUITE COMPOSEDLY AND
CONTENTEDLY SURE THAT SHAKESPEARE DIDNT AND STRONGLY SUSPECTS THAT
BACON DID WE ALL HAVE TO DO A GOOD DEAL OF ASSUMING BUT I AM FAIRLY
CERTAIN THAT IN EVERY CASE I CAN CALL TO MIND THE BACONIAN ASSUMERS
HAVE COME OUT AHEAD OF THE SHAKESPEARITES BOTH PARTIES HANDLE THE SAME
MATERIALS BUT THE BACONIANS SEEM TO ME TO GET MUCH MORE REASONABLE AND
RATIONAL AND PERSUASIVE RESULTS OUT OF THEM THAN IS THE CASE WITH THE
SHAKESPEARITES THE SHAKESPEARITE CONDUCTS HIS ASSUMING UPON A DEFINITE
PRINCIPLE AN UNCHANGING AND IMMUTABLE LAW WHICH IS AND AND AND
ADDED TOGETHER MAKE I BELIEVE THIS TO BE AN ERROR NO MATTER
YOU CANNOT GET A HABITSODDEN SHAKESPEARITE TO CIPHERUP HIS MATERIALS
UPON ANY OTHER BASIS WITH THE BACONIAN IT IS DIFFERENT IF YOU PLACE
BEFORE HIM THE ABOVE FIGURES AND SET HIM TO ADDING THEM UP HE WILL
NEVER IN ANY CASE GET MORE THAN OUT OF THEM AND IN NINE CASES OUT
OF TEN HE WILL GET JUST THE PROPER

LET ME TRY TO ILLUSTRATE THE TWO SYSTEMS IN A SIMPLE AND HOMELY WAY
CALCULATED TO BRING THE IDEA WITHIN THE GRASP OF THE IGNORANT AND
UNINTELLIGENT WE WILL SUPPOSE A CASE TAKE A LAPBRED HOUSEFED
UNEDUCATED INEXPERIENCED KITTEN TAKE A RUGGED OLD TOM THATS SCARRED
FROM STEM TO RUDDERPOST WITH THE MEMORIALS OF STRENUOUS EXPERIENCE
AND IS SO CULTURED SO EDUCATED SO LIMITLESSLY ERUDITE THAT ONE MAY
SAY OF HIM ALL CATKNOWLEDGE IS HIS PROVINCE ALSO TAKE A MOUSE
LOCK THE THREE UP IN A HOLELESS CRACKLESS EXITLESS PRISONCELL WAIT
HALF AN HOUR THEN OPEN THE CELL INTRODUCE A SHAKESPEARITE AND A
BACONIAN AND LET THEM CIPHER AND ASSUME THE MOUSE IS MISSING THE
QUESTION TO BE DECIDED IS WHERE IS IT YOU CAN GUESS BOTH VERDICTS
BEFOREHAND ONE VERDICT WILL SAY THE KITTEN CONTAINS THE MOUSE THE
OTHER WILL AS CERTAINLY SAY THE MOUSE IS IN THE TOMCAT

THE SHAKESPEARITE WILL REASON LIKE THISTHAT IS NOT MY WORD IT IS
HIS HE WILL SAY THE KITTEN MAY HAVE BEEN ATTENDING SCHOOL WHEN
NOBODY WAS NOTICING THEREFORE WE ARE WARRANTED IN ASSUMING THAT IT
DID SO ALSO IT COULD HAVE BEEN TRAINING IN A COURTCLERKS OFFICE
WHEN NO ONE WAS NOTICING SINCE THAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED WE ARE
JUSTIFIED IN ASSUMING THAT IT DID HAPPEN IT COULD HAVE STUDIED
CATOLOGY IN A GARRET WHEN NO ONE WAS NOTICINGTHEREFORE IT DID IT
COULD HAVE ATTENDED CATASSIZES ON THE SHEDROOF NIGHTS FOR
RECREATION WHEN NO ONE WAS NOTICING AND HAVE HARVESTED A KNOWLEDGE OF
CAT COURTFORMS AND CAT LAWYERTALK IN THAT WAY IT COULD HAVE DONE
IT THEREFORE WITHOUT A DOUBT IT DID IT COULD HAVE GONE SOLDIERING
WITH A WARTRIBE WHEN NO ONE WAS NOTICING AND LEARNED SOLDIERWILES
AND SOLDIERWAYS AND WHAT TO DO WITH A MOUSE WHEN OPPORTUNITY OFFERS
THE PLAIN INFERENCE THEREFORE IS THAT THAT IS WHAT IT DID SINCE
ALL THESE MANIFOLD THINGS COULD HAVE OCCURRED WE HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO BELIEVE THEY DID OCCUR THESE PATIENTLY AND PAINSTAKINGLY
ACCUMULATED VAST ACQUIREMENTS AND COMPETENCES NEEDED BUT ONE THING
MOREOPPORTUNITYTO CONVERT THEMSELVES INTO TRIUMPHANT ACTION THE
OPPORTUNITY CAME WE HAVE THE RESULT BEYOND SHADOW OF QUESTION THE
MOUSE IS IN THE KITTEN

IT IS PROPER TO REMARK THAT WHEN WE OF THE THREE CULTS PLANT A WE
THINK WE MAY ASSUME WE EXPECT IT UNDER CAREFUL WATERING AND
FERTILIZING AND TENDING TO GROW UP INTO A STRONG AND HARDY AND
WEATHERDEFYING THERE ISNT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT AT LASTAND IT
USUALLY HAPPENS

WE KNOW WHAT THE BACONIANS VERDICT WOULD BE THERE IS NOT A RAG OF
EVIDENCE THAT THE KITTEN HAS HAD ANY TRAINING ANY EDUCATION ANY
EXPERIENCE QUALIFYING IT FOR THE PRESENT OCCASION OR IS INDEED
EQUIPPED FOR ANY ACHIEVEMENT ABOVE LIFTING SUCH UNCLAIMED MILK AS COMES
ITS WAY BUT THERE IS ABUNDANT EVIDENCEUNASSAILABLE PROOF IN
FACTTHAT THE OTHER ANIMAL IS EQUIPPED TO THE LAST DETAIL WITH EVERY
QUALIFICATION NECESSARY FOR THE EVENT WITHOUT SHADOW OF DOUBT THE
TOMCAT CONTAINS THE MOUSE

VI

WHEN SHAKESPEARE DIED IN GREAT LITERARY PRODUCTIONS ATTRIBUTED
TO HIM AS AUTHOR HAD BEEN BEFORE THE LONDON WORLD AND IN HIGH FAVOR FOR
TWENTYFOUR YEARS YET HIS DEATH WAS NOT AN EVENT IT MADE NO STIR IT
ATTRACTED NO ATTENTION APPARENTLY HIS EMINENT LITERARY CONTEMPORARIES
DID NOT REALIZE THAT A CELEBRATED POET HAD PASSED FROM THEIR MIDST
PERHAPS THEY KNEW A PLAYACTOR OF MINOR RANK HAD DISAPPEARED BUT DID
NOT REGARD HIM AS THE AUTHOR OF HIS WORKS WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN
ASSUMING THIS

HIS DEATH WAS NOT EVEN AN EVENT IN THE LITTLE TOWN OF STRATFORD DOES
THIS MEAN THAT IN STRATFORD HE WAS NOT REGARDED AS A CELEBRITY OF ANY
KIND

WE ARE PRIVILEGED TO ASSUMENO WE ARE INDEED OBLIGED TO
ASSUMETHAT SUCH WAS THE CASE HE HAD SPENT THE FIRST TWENTYTWO OR
TWENTYTHREE YEARS OF HIS LIFE THERE AND OF COURSE KNEW EVERYBODY AND
WAS KNOWN BY EVERYBODY OF THAT DAY IN THE TOWN INCLUDING THE DOGS AND
THE CATS AND THE HORSES HE HAD SPENT THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS OF HIS
LIFE THERE DILIGENTLY TRADING IN EVERY BIG AND LITTLE THING THAT HAD
MONEY IN IT SO WE ARE COMPELLED TO ASSUME THAT MANY OF THE FOLK THERE
IN THOSE SAID LATTER DAYS KNEW HIM PERSONALLY AND THE REST BY SIGHT
AND HEARSAY BUT NOT AS A CELEBRITY APPARENTLY NOT FOR EVERYBODY
SOON FORGOT TO REMEMBER ANY CONTACT WITH HIM OR ANY INCIDENT CONNECTED
WITH HIM THE DOZENS OF TOWNSPEOPLE STILL ALIVE WHO HAD KNOWN OF HIM
OR KNOWN ABOUT HIM IN THE FIRST TWENTYTHREE YEARS OF HIS LIFE WERE IN
THE SAME UNREMEMBERING CONDITION IF THEY KNEW OF ANY INCIDENT
CONNECTED WITH THAT PERIOD OF HIS LIFE THEY DIDNT TELL ABOUT IT WOULD
THEY IF THEY HAD BEEN ASKED IT IS MOST LIKELY WERE THEY ASKED IT IS
PRETTY APPARENT THAT THEY WERE NOT WHY WERENT THEY IT IS A VERY
PLAUSIBLE GUESS THAT NOBODY THERE OR ELSEWHERE WAS INTERESTED TO KNOW

FOR SEVEN YEARS AFTER SHAKESPEARES DEATH NOBODY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN
INTERESTED IN HIM THEN THE QUARTO WAS PUBLISHED AND BEN JONSON AWOKE
OUT OF HIS LONG INDIFFERENCE AND SANG A SONG OF PRAISE AND PUT IT IN
THE FRONT OF THE BOOK THEN SILENCE FELL AGAIN

FOR SIXTY YEARS THEN INQUIRIES INTO SHAKESPEARES STRATFORD LIFE BEGAN
TO BE MADE OF STRATFORDIANS OF STRATFORDIANS WHO HAD KNOWN
SHAKESPEARE OR HAD SEEN HIM NO THEN OF STRATFORDIANS WHO HAD SEEN
PEOPLE WHO HAD KNOWN OR SEEN PEOPLE WHO HAD SEEN SHAKESPEARE NO
APPARENTLY THE INQUIRES WERE ONLY MADE OF STRATFORDIANS WHO WERE NOT
STRATFORDIANS OF SHAKESPEARES DAY BUT LATER COMERS AND WHAT THEY HAD
LEARNED HAD COME TO THEM FROM PERSONS WHO HAD NOT SEEN SHAKESPEARE AND
WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED WAS NOT CLAIMED AS FACT BUT ONLY AS LEGENDDIM
AND FADING AND INDEFINITE LEGEND LEGEND OF THE CALFSLAUGHTERING RANK
AND NOT WORTH REMEMBERING EITHER AS HISTORY OR FICTION

HAS IT EVER HAPPENED BEFOREOR SINCETHAT A CELEBRATED PERSON WHO HAD
SPENT EXACTLY HALF OF A FAIRLY LONG LIFE IN THE VILLAGE WHERE HE WAS
BORN AND REARED WAS ABLE TO SLIP OUT OF THIS WORLD AND LEAVE THAT
VILLAGE VOICELESS AND GOSSIPLESS BEHIND HIMUTTERLY VOICELESS UTTERLY
GOSSIPLESS AND PERMANENTLY SO I DONT BELIEVE IT HAS HAPPENED IN ANY
CASE EXCEPT SHAKESPEARES AND COULDNT AND WOULDNT HAVE HAPPENED IN
HIS CASE IF HE HAD BEEN REGARDED AS A CELEBRITY AT THE TIME OF HIS
DEATH

WHEN I EXAMINE MY OWN CASEBUT LET US DO THAT AND SEE IF IT WILL NOT
BE RECOGNIZABLE AS EXHIBITING A CONDITION OF THINGS QUITE LIKELY TO
RESULT MOST LIKELY TO RESULT INDEED SUBSTANTIALLY SURE TO RESULT IN
THE CASE OF A CELEBRATED PERSON A BENEFACTOR OF THE HUMAN RACE LIKE
ME

MY PARENTS BROUGHT ME TO THE VILLAGE OF HANNIBAL MISSOURI ON THE
BANKS OF THE MISSISSIPPI WHEN I WAS TWO AND A HALF YEARS OLD I
ENTERED SCHOOL AT FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND DRIFTED FROM ONE SCHOOL TO
ANOTHER IN THE VILLAGE DURING NINE AND A HALF YEARS THEN MY FATHER
DIED LEAVING HIS FAMILY IN EXCEEDINGLY STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES
WHEREFORE MY BOOKEDUCATION CAME TO A STANDSTILL FOREVER AND I BECAME
A PRINTERS APPRENTICE ON BOARD AND CLOTHES AND WHEN THE CLOTHES
FAILED I GOT A HYMNBOOK IN PLACE OF THEM THIS FOR SUMMER WEAR
PROBABLY I LIVED IN HANNIBAL FIFTEEN AND A HALF YEARS ALTOGETHER
THEN RAN AWAY ACCORDING TO THE CUSTOM OF PERSONS WHO ARE INTENDING TO
BECOME CELEBRATED I NEVER LIVED THERE AFTERWARD FOUR YEARS LATER I
BECAME A CUB ON A MISSISSIPPI STEAMBOAT IN THE ST LOUIS AND NEW
ORLEANS TRADE AND AFTER A YEAR AND A HALF OF HARD STUDY AND HARD WORK
THE US INSPECTORS RIGOROUSLY EXAMINED ME THROUGH A COUPLE OF LONG
SITTINGS AND DECIDED THAT I KNEW EVERY INCH OF THE MISSISSIPPITHIRTEEN
HUNDRED MILESIN THE DARK AND IN THE DAYAS WELL AS A BABY KNOWS THE
WAY TO ITS MOTHERS PAPS DAY OR NIGHT SO THEY LICENSED ME AS A
PILOTKNIGHTED ME SO TO SPEAKAND I ROSE UP CLOTHED WITH AUTHORITY A
RESPONSIBLE SERVANT OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT

NOW THEN SHAKESPEARE DIED YOUNGHE WAS ONLY FIFTYTWO HE HAD LIVED IN
HIS NATIVE VILLAGE TWENTYSIX YEARS OR ABOUT THAT HE DIED CELEBRATED
IF YOU BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ IN THE BOOKS YET WHEN HE DIED
NOBODY THERE OR ELSEWHERE TOOK ANY NOTICE OF IT AND FOR SIXTY YEARS
AFTERWARD NO TOWNSMAN REMEMBERED TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HIM OR ABOUT HIS
LIFE IN STRATFORD WHEN THE INQUIRER CAME AT LAST HE GOT BUT ONE
FACTNO LEGENDAND GOT THAT ONE AT SECOND HAND FROM A PERSON WHO
HAD ONLY HEARD IT AS A RUMOR AND DIDNT CLAIM COPYRIGHT IN IT AS A
PRODUCTION OF HIS OWN HE COULDNT VERY WELL FOR ITS DATE ANTEDATED
HIS OWN BIRTHDATE BUT NECESSARILY A NUMBER OF PERSONS WERE STILL
ALIVE IN STRATFORD WHO IN THE DAYS OF THEIR YOUTH HAD SEEN
SHAKESPEARE NEARLY EVERY DAY IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF HIS LIFE AND
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TELL THAT INQUIRER SOME FIRSTHAND THINGS
ABOUT HIM IF HE HAD IN THOSE LAST DAYS BEEN A CELEBRITY AND THEREFORE A
PERSON OF INTEREST TO THE VILLAGERS WHY DID NOT THE INQUIRER HUNT THEM
UP AND INTERVIEW THEM WASNT IT WORTH WHILE WASNT THE MATTER OF
SUFFICIENT CONSEQUENCE HAD THE INQUIRER AN ENGAGEMENT TO SEE A
DOGFIGHT AND COULDNT SPARE THE TIME

IT ALL SEEMS TO MEAN THAT HE NEVER HAD ANY LITERARY CELEBRITY THERE OR
ELSEWHERE AND NO CONSIDERABLE REPUTE AS ACTOR AND MANAGER

NOW THEN I AM AWAY ALONG IN LIFEMY SEVENTYTHIRD YEAR BEING ALREADY
WELL BEHIND MEYET SIXTEEN OF MY HANNIBAL SCHOOLMATES ARE STILL ALIVE
TODAY AND CAN TELLAND DO TELLINQUIRERS DOZENS AND DOZENS OF
INCIDENTS OF THEIR YOUNG LIVES AND MINE TOGETHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED
TO US IN THE MORNING OF LIFE IN THE BLOSSOM OF OUR YOUTH IN THE GOOD
DAYS THE DEAR DAYS THE DAYS WHEN WE WENT GIPSYING A LONG TIME AGO
MOST OF THEM CREDITABLE TO ME TOO ONE CHILD TO WHOM I PAID COURT WHEN
SHE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD AND I EIGHT STILL LIVES IN HANNIBAL AND SHE
VISITED ME LAST SUMMER TRAVERSING THE NECESSARY TEN OR TWELVE HUNDRED
MILES OF RAILROAD WITHOUT DAMAGE TO HER PATIENCE OR TO HER OLDYOUNG
VIGOR ANOTHER LITTLE LASSIE TO WHOM I PAID ATTENTION IN HANNIBAL WHEN
SHE WAS NINE YEARS OLD AND I THE SAME IS STILL ALIVEIN LONDONAND
HALE AND HEARTY JUST AS I AM AND ON THE FEW SURVIVING
STEAMBOATSTHOSE LINGERING GHOSTS AND REMEMBRANCERS OF GREAT FLEETS
THAT PLIED THE BIG RIVER IN THE BEGINNING OF MY WATERCAREERWHICH IS
EXACTLY AS LONG AGO AS THE WHOLE INVOICE OF THE LIFEYEARS OF
SHAKESPEARE NUMBERSTHERE ARE STILL FINDABLE TWO OR THREE RIVERPILOTS
WHO SAW ME DO CREDITABLE THINGS IN THOSE ANCIENT DAYS AND SEVERAL
WHITEHEADED ENGINEERS AND SEVERAL ROUSTABOUTS AND MATES AND SEVERAL
DECKHANDS WHO USED TO HEAVE THE LEAD FOR ME AND SEND UP ON THE STILL
NIGHT THE SIXFEETSCANT THAT MADE ME SHUDDER AND THE
MARKTWAIN THAT TOOK THE SHUDDER AWAY AND PRESENTLY THE
DARLING BY THE DEEPFOUR THAT LIFTED ME TO HEAVEN FOR JOY
THEY KNOW ABOUT ME AND CAN TELL AND SO DO PRINTERS FROM ST LOUIS TO
NEW YORK AND SO DO NEWSPAPER REPORTERS FROM NEVADA TO SAN FRANCISCO
AND SO DO THE POLICE IF SHAKESPEARE HAD REALLY BEEN CELEBRATED LIKE
ME STRATFORD COULD HAVE TOLD THINGS ABOUT HIM AND IF MY EXPERIENCE
GOES FOR ANYTHING THEYD HAVE DONE IT

IF I HAD UNDER MY SUPERINTENDENCE A CONTROVERSY APPOINTED TO DECIDE
WHETHER SHAKESPEARE WROTE SHAKESPEARE OR NOT I BELIEVE I WOULD PLACE
BEFORE THE DEBATERS ONLY THE ONE QUESTION WAS SHAKESPEARE EVER A
PRACTICING LAWYER AND LEAVE EVERYTHING ELSE OUT

IT IS MAINTAINED THAT THE MAN WHO WROTE THE PLAYS WAS NOT MERELY
MYRIADMINDED BUT ALSO MYRIADACCOMPLISHED THAT HE NOT ONLY KNEW SOME
THOUSANDS OF THINGS ABOUT HUMAN LIFE IN ALL ITS SHADES AND GRADES AND
ABOUT THE HUNDRED ARTS AND TRADES AND CRAFTS AND PROFESSIONS WHICH MEN
BUSY THEMSELVES IN BUT THAT HE COULD TALK ABOUT THE MEN AND THEIR
GRADES AND TRADES ACCURATELY MAKING NO MISTAKES MAYBE IT IS SO BUT
HAVE THE EXPERTS SPOKEN OR IS IT ONLY TOM DICK AND HARRY DOES THE
EXHIBIT STAND UPON WIDE AND LOOSE AND ELOQUENT GENERALIZINGWHICH IS
NOT EVIDENCE AND NOT PROOFOR UPON DETAILS PARTICULARS STATISTICS
ILLUSTRATIONS DEMONSTRATIONS

EXPERTS OF UNCHALLENGEABLE AUTHORITY HAVE TESTIFIED DEFINITELY AS TO
ONLY ONE OF SHAKESPEARES MULTIFARIOUS CRAFTEQUIPMENTS SO FAR AS MY
RECOLLECTIONS OF SHAKESPEAREBACON TALK ABIDE WITH MEHIS
LAWEQUIPMENT I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT WELLINGTON OR NAPOLEON EVER
EXAMINED SHAKESPEARES BATTLES AND SIEGES AND STRATEGIES AND THEN
DECIDED AND ESTABLISHED FOR GOOD AND ALL THAT THEY WERE MILITARILY
FLAWLESS I DO NOT REMEMBER THAT ANY NELSON OR DRAKE OR COOK EVER
EXAMINED HIS SEAMANSHIP AND SAID IT SHOWED PROFOUND AND ACCURATE
FAMILIARITY WITH THAT ART I DONT REMEMBER THAT ANY KING OR PRINCE OR
DUKE HAS EVER TESTIFIED THAT SHAKESPEARE WAS LETTERPERFECT IN HIS
HANDLING OF ROYAL COURTMANNERS AND THE TALK AND MANNERS OF
ARISTOCRACIES I DONT REMEMBER THAT ANY ILLUSTRIOUS LATINIST OR
GRECIAN OR FRENCHMAN OR SPANIARD OR ITALIAN HAS PROCLAIMED HIM A
PASTMASTER IN THOSE LANGUAGES I DONT REMEMBERWELL I DONT REMEMBER
THAT THERE IS TESTIMONYGREAT TESTIMONYIMPOSING
TESTIMONYUNANSWERABLE AND UNATTACKABLE TESTIMONY AS TO ANY OF
SHAKESPEARES HUNDRED SPECIALTIES EXCEPT ONETHE LAW

OTHER THINGS CHANGE WITH TIME AND THE STUDENT CANNOT TRACE BACK WITH
CERTAINTY THE CHANGES THAT VARIOUS TRADES AND THEIR PROCESSES AND
TECHNICALITIES HAVE UNDERGONE IN THE LONG STRETCH OF A CENTURY OR TWO
AND FIND OUT WHAT THEIR PROCESSES AND TECHNICALITIES WERE IN THOSE
EARLY DAYS BUT WITH THE LAW IT IS DIFFERENT IT IS MILESTONED AND
DOCUMENTED ALL THE WAY BACK AND THE MASTER OF THAT WONDERFUL TRADE
THAT COMPLEX AND INTRICATE TRADE THAT AWECOMPELLING TRADE HAS
COMPETENT WAYS OF KNOWING WHETHER SHAKESPEARELAW IS GOOD LAW OR NOT
AND WHETHER HIS LAWCOURT PROCEDURE IS CORRECT OR NOT AND WHETHER HIS
LEGAL SHOPTALK IS THE SHOPTALK OF A VETERAN PRACTITIONER OR ONLY A
MACHINEMADE COUNTERFEIT OF IT GATHERED FROM BOOKS AND FROM OCCASIONAL
LOITERINGS IN WESTMINSTER

RICHARD H DANA SERVED TWO YEARS BEFORE THE MAST AND HAD EVERY
EXPERIENCE THAT FALLS TO THE LOT OF THE SAILOR BEFORE THE MAST OF OUR
DAY HIS SAILORTALK FLOWS FROM HIS PEN WITH THE SURE TOUCH AND THE
EASE AND CONFIDENCE OF A PERSON WHO HAS LIVED WHAT HE IS TALKING
ABOUT NOT GATHERED IT FROM BOOKS AND RANDOM LISTENINGS HEAR HIM

HAVING HOVE SHORT CAST OFF THE GASKETS AND MADE THE BUNT OF EACH SAIL
FAST BY THE JIGGER WITH A MAN ON EACH YARD AT THE WORD THE WHOLE
CANVAS OF THE SHIP WAS LOOSED AND WITH THE GREATEST RAPIDITY POSSIBLE
EVERYTHING WAS SHEETED HOME AND HOISTED UP THE ANCHOR TRIPPED AND
CATHEADED AND THE SHIP UNDER HEADWAY


AGAIN

THE ROYAL YARDS WERE ALL CROSSED AT ONCE AND ROYALS AND SKYSAILS SET
AND AS WE HAD THE WIND FREE THE BOOMS WERE RUN OUT AND ALL WERE
ALOFT ACTIVE AS CATS LAYING OUT ON THE YARDS AND BOOMS REEVING THE
STUDDINGSAIL GEAR AND SAIL AFTER SAIL THE CAPTAIN PILED UPON HER
UNTIL SHE WAS COVERED WITH CANVAS HER SAILS LOOKING LIKE A GREAT WHITE
CLOUD RESTING UPON A BLACK SPECK


ONCE MORE A RACE IN THE PACIFIC

OUR ANTAGONIST WAS IN HER BEST TRIM BEING CLEAR OF THE POINT THE
BREEZE BECAME STIFF AND THE ROYALMASTS BENT UNDER OUR SAILS BUT WE
WOULD NOT TAKE THEM IN UNTIL WE SAW THREE BOYS SPRING INTO THE RIGGING
OF THE CALIFORNIA THEN THEY WERE ALL FURLED AT ONCE BUT WITH ORDERS
TO OUR BOYS TO STAY ALOFT AT THE TOPGALLANT MASTHEADS AND LOOSE THEM
AGAIN AT THE WORD IT WAS MY DUTY TO FURL THE FOREROYAL AND WHILE
STANDING BY TO LOOSE IT AGAIN I HAD A FINE VIEW OF THE SCENE FROM
WHERE I STOOD THE TWO VESSELS SEEMED NOTHING BUT SPARS AND SAILS
WHILE THEIR NARROW DECKS FAR BELOW SLANTING OVER BY THE FORCE OF THE
WIND ALOFT APPEARED HARDLY CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE GREAT FABRICS
RAISED UPON THEM THE CALIFORNIA WAS TO WINDWARD OF US AND HAD EVERY
ADVANTAGE YET WHILE THE BREEZE WAS STIFF WE HELD OUR OWN AS SOON AS
IT BEGAN TO SLACKEN SHE RANGED A LITTLE AHEAD AND THE ORDER WAS GIVEN
TO LOOSE THE ROYALS IN AN INSTANT THE GASKETS WERE OFF AND THE BUNT
DROPPED SHEET HOME THE FOREROYALWEATHER SHEETS HOMELEE

WHAT WOULD THE CAPTAIN OF ANY SAILINGVESSEL OF OUR TIME SAY TO THAT
HE WOULD SAY THE MAN THAT WROTE THAT DIDNT LEARN HIS TRADE OUT OF A
BOOK HE HAS BEEN THERE BUT WOULD THIS SAME CAPTAIN BE COMPETENT TO
SIT IN JUDGMENT UPON SHAKESPEARES SEAMANSHIPCONSIDERING THE CHANGES
IN SHIPS AND SHIPTALK THAT HAVE NECESSARILY TAKEN PLACE UNRECORDED
UNREMEMBERED AND LOST TO HISTORY IN THE LAST THREE HUNDRED YEARS IT
IS MY CONVICTION THAT SHAKESPEARES SAILORTALK WOULD BE CHOCTAW TO
HIM FOR INSTANCEFROM THE TEMPEST

THAT WILL DO FOR THE PRESENT LET US YARE A LITTLE NOW FOR A CHANGE

IF A MAN SHOULD WRITE A BOOK AND IN IT MAKE ONE OF HIS CHARACTERS SAY
HERE DEVIL EMPTY THE QUOINS INTO THE STANDING GALLEY AND THE
IMPOSINGSTONE INTO THE HELLBOX ASSEMBLE THE COMPS AROUND THE FRISKET
AND LET THEM JEFF FOR TAKES AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT I SHOULD RECOGNIZE
A MISTAKE OR TWO IN THE PHRASING AND WOULD KNOW THAT THE WRITER WAS
ONLY A PRINTER THEORETICALLY NOT PRACTICALLY

I HAVE BEEN A QUARTZ MINER IN THE SILVER REGIONSA PRETTY HARD LIFE I
KNOW ALL THE PALAVER OF THAT BUSINESS I KNOW ALL ABOUT DISCOVERY
CLAIMS AND THE SUBORDINATE CLAIMS I KNOW ALL ABOUT LODES LEDGES
OUTCROPPINGS DIPS SPURS ANGLES SHAFTS DRIFTS INCLINES LEVELS
TUNNELS AIRSHAFTS HORSES CLAY CASINGS GRANITE CASINGS QUARTZ
MILLS AND THEIR BATTERIES ARASTRAS AND HOW TO CHARGE THEM WITH
QUICKSILVER AND SULPHATE OF COPPER AND HOW TO CLEAN THEM UP AND HOW
TO REDUCE THE RESULTING AMALGAM IN THE RETORTS AND HOW TO CAST THE
BULLION INTO PIGS AND FINALLY I KNOW HOW TO SCREEN TAILINGS AND ALSO
HOW TO HUNT FOR SOMETHING LESS ROBUST TO DO AND FIND IT I KNOW THE
ARGOT OF THE QUARTZMINING AND MILLING INDUSTRY FAMILIARLY AND SO
WHENEVER BRET HARTE INTRODUCES THAT INDUSTRY INTO A STORY THE FIRST
TIME ONE OF HIS MINERS OPENS HIS MOUTH I RECOGNIZE FROM HIS PHRASING
THAT HARTE GOT THE PHRASING BY LISTENINGLIKE SHAKESPEAREI MEAN THE
STRATFORD ONENOT BY EXPERIENCE NO ONE CAN TALK THE QUARTZ DIALECT
CORRECTLY WITHOUT LEARNING IT WITH PICK AND SHOVEL AND DRILL AND FUSE

I HAVE BEEN A SURFACE MINERGOLDAND I KNOW ALL ITS MYSTERIES AND THE
DIALECT THAT BELONGS WITH THEM AND WHENEVER HARTE INTRODUCES THAT
INDUSTRY INTO A STORY I KNOW BY THE PHRASING OF HIS CHARACTERS THAT
NEITHER HE NOR THEY HAVE EVER SERVED THAT TRADE

I HAVE BEEN A POCKET MINERA SORT OF GOLD MINING NOT FINDABLE IN ANY
BUT ONE LITTLE SPOT IN THE WORLD SO FAR AS I KNOW I KNOW HOW WITH
HORN AND WATER TO FIND THE TRAIL OF A POCKET AND TRACE IT STEP BY STEP
AND STAGE BY STAGE UP THE MOUNTAIN TO ITS SOURCE AND FIND THE COMPACT
LITTLE NEST OF YELLOW METAL REPOSING IN ITS SECRET HOME UNDER THE
GROUND I KNOW THE LANGUAGE OF THAT TRADE THAT CAPRICIOUS TRADE THAT
FASCINATING BURIEDTREASURE TRADE AND CAN CATCH ANY WRITER WHO TRIES
TO USE IT WITHOUT HAVING LEARNED IT BY THE SWEAT OF HIS BROW AND THE
LABOR OF HIS HANDS

I KNOW SEVERAL OTHER TRADES AND THE ARGOT THAT GOES WITH THEM AND
WHENEVER A PERSON TRIES TO TALK THE TALK PECULIAR TO ANY OF THEM
WITHOUT HAVING LEARNED IT AT ITS SOURCE I CAN TRAP HIM ALWAYS BEFORE HE
GETS FAR ON HIS ROAD

AND SO AS I HAVE ALREADY REMARKED IF I WERE REQUIRED TO SUPERINTEND A
BACONSHAKESPEARE CONTROVERSY I WOULD NARROW THE MATTER DOWN TO A
SINGLE QUESTIONTHE ONLY ONE SO FAR AS THE PREVIOUS CONTROVERSIES HAVE
INFORMED ME CONCERNING WHICH ILLUSTRIOUS EXPERTS OF UNIMPEACHABLE
COMPETENCY HAVE TESTIFIED WAS THE AUTHOR OF SHAKESPEARES WORKS A
LAWYERA LAWYER DEEPLY READ AND OF LIMITLESS EXPERIENCE I WOULD PUT
ASIDE THE GUESSES AND SURMISES AND PERHAPSES AND MIGHTHAVEBEENS
AND COULDHAVEBEENS AND MUSTHAVEBEENS AND
WEAREJUSTIFIEDINPRESUMINGSAND THE REST OF THOSE VAGUE SPECTERS AND
SHADOWS AND INDEFINITENESSES AND STAND OR FALL WIN OR LOSE BY THE
VERDICT RENDERED BY THE JURY UPON THAT SINGLE QUESTION IF THE VERDICT
WAS YES I SHOULD FEEL QUITE CONVINCED THAT THE STRATFORD SHAKESPEARE
THE ACTOR MANAGER AND TRADER WHO DIED SO OBSCURE SO FORGOTTEN SO
DESTITUTE OF EVEN VILLAGE CONSEQUENCE THAT SIXTY YEARS AFTERWARD NO
FELLOWCITIZEN AND FRIEND OF HIS LATER DAYS REMEMBERED TO TELL ANYTHING
ABOUT HIM DID NOT WRITE THE WORKS

CHAPTER XIII OF THE SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM RESTATED BEARS THE HEADING
SHAKESPEARE AS A LAWYER AND COMPRISES SOME FIFTY PAGES OF EXPERT
TESTIMONY WITH COMMENTS THEREON AND I WILL COPY THE FIRST NINE AS
BEING SUFFICIENT ALL BY THEMSELVES AS IT SEEMS TO ME TO SETTLE THE
QUESTION WHICH I HAVE CONCEIVED TO BE THE MASTERKEY TO THE
SHAKESPEAREBACON PUZZLE

VIII

SHAKESPEARE AS A LAWYER

FROM CHAPTER XIII OF THE SHAKESPEARE PROBLEM RESTATED BY GEORGE
G GREENWOOD MP JOHN LANE COMPANY PUBLISHERS


THE PLAYS AND POEMS OF SHAKESPEARE SUPPLY AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT THEIR
AUTHOR NOT ONLY HAD A VERY EXTENSIVE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF LAW BUT
THAT HE WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF MEMBERS OF
THE INNS OF COURT AND WITH LEGAL LIFE GENERALLY

WHILE NOVELISTS AND DRAMATISTS ARE CONSTANTLY MAKING MISTAKES AS TO
THE LAWS OF MARRIAGE OF WILLS AND INHERITANCE TO SHAKESPEARES LAW
LAVISHLY AS HE EXPOUNDS IT THERE CAN NEITHER BE DEMURRER NOR BILL OF
EXCEPTIONS NOR WRIT OF ERROR SUCH WAS THE TESTIMONY BORNE BY ONE OF
THE MOST DISTINGUISHED LAWYERS OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WHO WAS RAISED
TO THE HIGH OFFICE OF LORD CHIEF JUSTICE IN AND SUBSEQUENTLY
BECAME LORD CHANCELLOR ITS WEIGHT WILL DOUBTLESS BE MORE APPRECIATED
BY LAWYERS THAN BY LAYMEN FOR ONLY LAWYERS KNOW HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SERVED AN APPRENTICESHIP TO THE LAW TO AVOID
DISPLAYING THEIR IGNORANCE IF THEY VENTURE TO EMPLOY LEGAL TERMS AND TO
DISCUSS LEGAL DOCTRINES THERE IS NOTHING SO DANGEROUS WROTE LORD
CAMPBELL AS FOR ONE NOT OF THE CRAFT TO TAMPER WITH OUR FREEMASONRY
A LAYMAN IS CERTAIN TO BETRAY HIMSELF BY USING SOME EXPRESSION WHICH A
LAWYER WOULD NEVER EMPLOY MR SIDNEY LEE HIMSELF SUPPLIES US WITH AN
EXAMPLE OF THIS HE WRITES P ON FEBRUARY
SHAKESPEARE OBTAINED JUDGMENT FROM A JURY AGAINST ADDENBROKE FOR THE
PAYMENT OF NO AND NO S D COSTS NOW A LAWYER WOULD NEVER
HAVE SPOKEN OF OBTAINING JUDGMENT FROM A JURY FOR IT IS THE FUNCTION
OF A JURY NOT TO DELIVER JUDGMENT WHICH IS THE PREROGATIVE OF THE
COURT BUT TO FIND A VERDICT ON THE FACTS THE ERROR IS INDEED A
VENIAL ONE BUT IT IS JUST ONE OF THOSE LITTLE THINGS WHICH AT ONCE
ENABLE A LAWYER TO KNOW IF THE WRITER IS A LAYMAN OR ONE OF THE
CRAFT

BUT WHEN A LAYMAN VENTURES TO PLUNGE DEEPLY INTO LEGAL SUBJECTS HE IS
NATURALLY APT TO MAKE AN EXHIBITION OF HIS INCOMPETENCE LET A
NONPROFESSIONAL MAN HOWEVER ACUTE WRITES LORD CAMPBELL AGAIN
PRESUME TO TALK LAW OR TO DRAW ILLUSTRATIONS FROM LEGAL SCIENCE IN
DISCUSSING OTHER SUBJECTS AND HE WILL SPEEDILY FALL INTO LAUGHABLE
ABSURDITY

AND WHAT DOES THE SAME HIGH AUTHORITY SAY ABOUT SHAKESPEARE HE HAD A
DEEP TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW AND AN EASY FAMILIARITY WITH
SOME OF THE MOST ABSTRUSE PROCEEDINGS IN ENGLISH JURISPRUDENCE AND
AGAIN WHENEVER HE INDULGES THIS PROPENSITY HE UNIFORMLY LAYS DOWN
GOOD LAW OF HENRY IV PART HE SAYS IF LORD ELDON COULD BE
SUPPOSED TO HAVE WRITTEN THE PLAY I DO NOT SEE HOW HE COULD BE
CHARGEABLE WITH HAVING FORGOTTEN ANY OF HIS LAW WHILE WRITING IT
CHARLES AND MARY COWDEN CLARKE SPEAK OF THE MARVELOUS INTIMACY WHICH
HE DISPLAYS WITH LEGAL TERMS HIS FREQUENT ADOPTION OF THEM IN
ILLUSTRATION AND HIS CURIOUSLY TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR FORM AND
FORCE MALONE HIMSELF A LAWYER WROTE HIS KNOWLEDGE OF LEGAL TERMS
IS NOT MERELY SUCH AS MIGHT BE ACQUIRED BY THE CASUAL OBSERVATION OF
EVEN HIS ALLCOMPREHENDING MIND IT HAS THE APPEARANCE OF TECHNICAL
SKILL ANOTHER LAWYER AND WELL KNOWN SHAKESPEAREAN RICHARD GRANT
WHITE SAYS NO DRAMATIST OF THE TIME NOT EVEN BEAUMONT WHO WAS THE
YOUNGER SON OF A JUDGE OF THE COMMON PLEAS AND WHO AFTER STUDYING IN
THE INNS OF COURT ABANDONED LAW FOR THE DRAMA USED LEGAL PHRASES WITH
SHAKESPEARES READINESS AND EXACTNESS AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS
FACT IS HEIGHTENED BY ANOTHER THAT IT IS ONLY TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE
LAW THAT HE EXHIBITS THIS INCLINATION THE PHRASES PECULIAR TO OTHER
OCCUPATIONS SERVE HIM ON RARE OCCASIONS BY WAY OF DESCRIPTION
COMPARISON OR ILLUSTRATION GENERALLY WHEN SOMETHING IN THE SCENE
SUGGESTS THEM BUT LEGAL PHRASES FLOW FROM HIS PEN AS PART OF HIS
VOCABULARY AND PARCEL OF HIS THOUGHT TAKE THE WORD PURCHASE FOR
INSTANCE WHICH IN ORDINARY USE MEANS TO ACQUIRE BY GIVING VALUE BUT
APPLIES IN LAW TO ALL LEGAL MODES OF OBTAINING PROPERTY EXCEPT BY
INHERITANCE OR DESCENT AND IN THIS PECULIAR SENSE THE WORD OCCURS FIVE
TIMES IN SHAKESPEARES THIRTYFOUR PLAYS AND ONLY IN ONE SINGLE
INSTANCE IN THE FIFTYFOUR PLAYS OF BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER IT HAS BEEN
SUGGESTED THAT IT WAS IN ATTENDANCE UPON THE COURTS IN LONDON THAT HE
PICKED UP HIS LEGAL VOCABULARY BUT THIS SUPPOSITION NOT ONLY FAILS TO
ACCOUNT FOR SHAKESPEARES PECULIAR FREEDOM AND EXACTNESS IN THE USE OF
THAT PHRASEOLOGY IT DOES NOT EVEN PLACE HIM IN THE WAY OF LEARNING
THOSE TERMS HIS USE OF WHICH IS MOST REMARKABLE WHICH ARE NOT SUCH AS
HE WOULD HAVE HEARD AT ORDINARY PROCEEDINGS AT NISI PRIUS BUT SUCH
AS REFER TO THE TENURE OR TRANSFER OF REAL PROPERTY FINE AND
RECOVERY STATUTES MERCHANT PURCHASE INDENTURE TENURE
DOUBLE VOUCHER FEE SIMPLE FEE FARM REMAINDER REVERSION
FORFEITURE ETC THIS CONVEYANCERS JARGON COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PICKED
UP BY HANGING ROUND THE COURTS OF LAW IN LONDON TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY
YEARS AGO WHEN SUITS AS TO THE TITLE OF REAL PROPERTY WERE
COMPARATIVELY RARE AND BESIDES SHAKESPEARE USES HIS LAW JUST AS
FREELY IN HIS FIRST PLAYS WRITTEN IN HIS FIRST LONDON YEARS AS IN
THOSE PRODUCED AT A LATER PERIOD JUST AS EXACTLY TOO FOR THE
CORRECTNESS AND PROPRIETY WITH WHICH THESE TERMS ARE INTRODUCED HAVE
COMPELLED THE ADMIRATION OF A CHIEF JUSTICE AND A LORD CHANCELLOR

SENATOR DAVIS WROTE WE SEEM TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE THAN A SCIOLISTS
TEMERITY OF INDULGENCE IN THE TERMS OF AN UNFAMILIAR ART NO LEGAL
SOLECISMS WILL BE FOUND THE ABSTRUSEST ELEMENTS OF THE COMMON LAW ARE
IMPRESSED INTO A DISCIPLINED SERVICE OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHERE SUCH
KNOWLEDGE IS UNEXAMPLED IN WRITERS UNLEARNED IN THE LAW SHAKESPEARE
APPEARS IN PERFECT POSSESSION OF IT IN THE LAW OF REAL PROPERTY ITS
RULES OF TENURE AND DESCENTS ITS ENTAILS ITS FINES AND RECOVERIES
THEIR VOUCHERS AND DOUBLE VOUCHERS IN THE PROCEDURE OF THE COURTS THE
METHOD OF BRINGING WRITS AND ARRESTS THE NATURE OF ACTIONS THE RULES
OF PLEADING THE LAW OF ESCAPES AND OF CONTEMPT OF COURT IN THE
PRINCIPLES OF EVIDENCE BOTH TECHNICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL IN THE
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TEMPORAL AND SPIRITUAL TRIBUNALS IN THE LAW OF
ATTAINDER AND FORFEITURE IN THE REQUISITES OF A VALID MARRIAGE IN THE
PRESUMPTION OF LEGITIMACY IN THE LEARNING OF THE LAW OF PREROGATIVE
IN THE INALIENABLE CHARACTER OF THE CROWN THIS MASTERSHIP APPEARS WITH
SURPRISING AUTHORITY

TO ALL THIS TESTIMONY AND THERE IS MUCH MORE WHICH I HAVE NOT CITED
MAY NOW BE ADDED THAT OF A GREAT LAWYER OF OUR OWN TIMES VIZ SIR
JAMES PLAISTED WILDE QC CREATED A BARON OF THE EXCHEQUER IN
PROMOTED TO THE POST OF JUDGEORDINARY AND JUDGE OF THE COURTS OF
PROBATE AND DIVORCE IN AND BETTER KNOWN TO THE WORLD AS LORD
PENZANCE TO WHICH DIGNITY HE WAS RAISED IN LORD PENZANCE AS ALL
LAWYERS KNOW AND AS THE LATE MR INDERWICK KC HAS TESTIFIED WAS
ONE OF THE FIRST LEGAL AUTHORITIES OF HIS DAY FAMOUS FOR HIS
REMARKABLE GRASP OF LEGAL PRINCIPLES AND ENDOWED BY NATURE WITH A
REMARKABLE FACILITY FOR MARSHALING FACTS AND FOR A CLEAR EXPRESSION OF
HIS VIEWS

LORD PENZANCE SPEAKS OF SHAKESPEARES PERFECT FAMILIARITY WITH NOT
ONLY THE PRINCIPLES AXIOMS AND MAXIMS BUT THE TECHNICALITIES OF
ENGLISH LAW A KNOWLEDGE SO PERFECT AND INTIMATE THAT HE WAS NEVER
INCORRECT AND NEVER AT FAULT THE MODE IN WHICH THIS KNOWLEDGE WAS
PRESSED INTO SERVICE ON ALL OCCASIONS TO EXPRESS HIS MEANING AND
ILLUSTRATE HIS THOUGHTS WAS QUITE UNEXAMPLED HE SEEMS TO HAVE HAD A
SPECIAL PLEASURE IN HIS COMPLETE AND READY MASTERSHIP OF IT IN ALL ITS
BRANCHES AS MANIFESTED IN THE PLAYS THIS LEGAL KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING
HAD THEREFORE A SPECIAL CHARACTER WHICH PLACES IT ON A WHOLLY DIFFERENT
FOOTING FROM THE REST OF THE MULTIFARIOUS KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS EXHIBITED
IN PAGE AFTER PAGE OF THE PLAYS AT EVERY TURN AND POINT AT WHICH THE
AUTHOR REQUIRED A METAPHOR SIMILE OR ILLUSTRATION HIS MIND EVER
TURNED FIRST TO THE LAW HE SEEMS ALMOST TO HAVE THOUGHT IN LEGAL
PHRASES THE COMMONEST OF LEGAL EXPRESSIONS WERE EVER AT THE END OF HIS
PEN IN DESCRIPTION OR ILLUSTRATION THAT HE SHOULD HAVE DESCANTED IN
LAWYER LANGUAGE WHEN HE HAD A FORENSIC SUBJECT IN HAND SUCH AS
SHYLOCKS BOND WAS TO BE EXPECTED BUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF LAW IN
SHAKESPEARE WAS EXHIBITED IN A FAR DIFFERENT MANNER IT PROTRUDED
ITSELF ON ALL OCCASIONS APPROPRIATE OR INAPPROPRIATE AND MINGLED
ITSELF WITH STRAINS OF THOUGHT WIDELY DIVERGENT FROM FORENSIC
SUBJECTS AGAIN TO ACQUIRE A PERFECT FAMILIARITY WITH LEGAL
PRINCIPLES AND AN ACCURATE AND READY USE OF THE TECHNICAL TERMS AND
PHRASES NOT ONLY OF THE CONVEYANCERS OFFICE BUT OF THE PLEADERS
CHAMBERS AND THE COURTS AT WESTMINSTER NOTHING SHORT OF EMPLOYMENT IN
SOME CAREER INVOLVING CONSTANT CONTACT WITH LEGAL QUESTIONS AND GENERAL
LEGAL WORK WOULD BE REQUISITE BUT A CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT INVOLVES THE
ELEMENT OF TIME AND TIME WAS JUST WHAT THE MANAGER OF TWO THEATERS HAD
NOT AT HIS DISPOSAL IN WHAT PORTION OF SHAKESPEARES IE
SHAKSPERES CAREER WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO POINT OUT THAT TIME COULD
BE FOUND FOR THE INTERPOSITION OF A LEGAL EMPLOYMENT IN THE CHAMBERS OR
OFFICES OF PRACTICING LAWYERS

STRATFORDIANS AS IS WELL KNOWN CASTING ABOUT FOR SOME POSSIBLE
EXPLANATION OF SHAKESPEARES EXTRAORDINARY KNOWLEDGE OF LAW HAVE MADE
THE SUGGESTION THAT SHAKESPEARE MIGHT CONCEIVABLY HAVE BEEN A CLERK
IN AN ATTORNEYS OFFICE BEFORE HE CAME TO LONDON MR COLLIER WROTE TO
LORD CAMPBELL TO ASK HIS OPINION AS TO THE PROBABILITY OF THIS BEING
TRUE HIS ANSWER WAS AS FOLLOWS YOU REQUIRE US TO BELIEVE IMPLICITLY
A FACT OF WHICH IF TRUE POSITIVE AND IRREFRAGABLE EVIDENCE IN HIS
OWN HANDWRITING MIGHT HAVE BEEN FORTHCOMING TO ESTABLISH IT NOT HAVING
BEEN ACTUALLY ENROLLED AS AN ATTORNEY NEITHER THE RECORDS OF THE LOCAL
COURT AT STRATFORD NOR OF THE SUPERIOR COURTS AT WESTMINSTER WOULD
PRESENT HIS NAME AS BEING CONCERNED IN ANY SUIT AS AN ATTORNEY BUT IT
MIGHT REASONABLY HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD BE DEEDS OR WILLS
WITNESSED BY HIM STILL EXTANT AND AFTER A VERY DILIGENT SEARCH NONE
SUCH CAN BE DISCOVERED

UPON THIS LORD PENZANCE COMMENTS IT CANNOT BE DOUBTED THAT LORD
CAMPBELL WAS RIGHT IN THIS NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE BEEN AT WORK IN AN
ATTORNEYS OFFICE WITHOUT BEING CALLED UPON CONTINUALLY TO ACT AS A
WITNESS AND IN MANY OTHER WAYS LEAVING TRACES OF HIS WORK AND NAME
THERE IS NOT A SINGLE FACT OR INCIDENT IN ALL THAT IS KNOWN OF
SHAKESPEARE EVEN BY RUMOR OR TRADITION WHICH SUPPORTS THIS NOTION OF
A CLERKSHIP AND AFTER MUCH ARGUMENT AND SURMISE WHICH HAS BEEN
INDULGED IN ON THIS SUBJECT WE MAY I THINK SAFELY PUT THE NOTION ON
ONE SIDE FOR NO LESS AN AUTHORITY THAN MR GRANT WHITE SAYS FINALLY
THAT THE IDEA OF HIS HAVING BEEN CLERK TO AN ATTORNEY HAS BEEN BLOWN
TO PIECES

IT IS ALTOGETHER CHARACTERISTIC OF MR CHURTON COLLINS THAT HE
NEVERTHELESS ADOPTS THIS EXPLODED MYTH THAT SHAKESPEARE WAS IN EARLY
LIFE EMPLOYED AS A CLERK IN AN ATTORNEYS OFFICE MAY BE CORRECT AT
STRATFORD THERE WAS BY ROYAL CHARTER A COURT OF RECORD SITTING EVERY
FORTNIGHT WITH SIX ATTORNEYS BESIDES THE TOWN CLERK BELONGING TO IT
AND IT IS CERTAINLY NOT STRAINING PROBABILITY TO SUPPOSE THAT THE YOUNG
SHAKESPEARE MAY HAVE HAD EMPLOYMENT IN ONE OF THEM THERE IS IT IS
TRUE NO TRADITION TO THIS EFFECT BUT SUCH TRADITIONS AS WE HAVE ABOUT
SHAKESPEARES OCCUPATION BETWEEN THE TIME OF LEAVING SCHOOL AND GOING
TO LONDON ARE SO LOOSE AND BASELESS THAT NO CONFIDENCE CAN BE PLACED IN
THEM IT IS TO SAY THE LEAST MORE PROBABLE THAT HE WAS IN AN
ATTORNEYS OFFICE THAN THAT HE WAS A BUTCHER KILLING CALVES IN A HIGH
STYLE AND MAKING SPEECHES OVER THEM

THIS IS A CHARMING SPECIMEN OF STRATFORDIAN ARGUMENT THERE IS AS WE
HAVE SEEN A VERY OLD TRADITION THAT SHAKESPEARE WAS A BUTCHERS
APPRENTICE JOHN DOWDALL WHO MADE A TOUR IN WARWICKSHIRE IN
TESTIFIES TO IT AS COMING FROM THE OLD CLERK WHO SHOWED HIM OVER THE
CHURCH AND IT IS UNHESITATINGLY ACCEPTED AS TRUE BY MR
HALLIWELLPHILLIPPS VOL I P AND VOL II PP MR
SIDNEY LEE SEES NOTHING IMPROBABLE IN IT AND IT IS SUPPORTED BY
AUBREY WHO MUST HAVE WRITTEN HIS ACCOUNT SOME TIME BEFORE WHEN
HIS MANUSCRIPT WAS COMPLETED OF THE ATTORNEYS CLERK HYPOTHESIS ON
THE OTHER HAND THERE IS NOT THE FAINTEST VESTIGE OF A TRADITION IT
HAS BEEN EVOLVED OUT OF THE FERTILE IMAGINATIONS OF EMBARRASSED
STRATFORDIANS SEEKING FOR SOME EXPLANATION OF THE STRATFORD RUSTICS
MARVELOUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH LAW AND LEGAL TERMS AND LEGAL LIFE BUT MR
CHURTON COLLINS HAS NOT THE LEAST HESITATION IN THROWING OVER THE
TRADITION WHICH HAS THE WARRANT OF ANTIQUITY AND SETTING UP IN ITS
STEAD THIS RIDICULOUS INVENTION FOR WHICH NOT ONLY IS THERE NO SHRED
OF POSITIVE EVIDENCE BUT WHICH AS LORD CAMPBELL AND LORD PENZANCE
POINT OUT IS REALLY PUT OUT OF COURT BY THE NEGATIVE EVIDENCE SINCE
NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE BEEN AT WORK IN AN ATTORNEYS OFFICE WITHOUT
BEING CALLED UPON CONTINUALLY TO ACT AS A WITNESS AND IN MANY OTHER
WAYS LEAVING TRACES OF HIS WORK AND NAME AND AS MR EDWARDS FURTHER
POINTS OUT SINCE THE DAY WHEN LORD CAMPBELLS BOOK WAS PUBLISHED
BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY YEARS AGO EVERY OLD DEED OR WILL TO SAY
NOTHING OF OTHER LEGAL PAPERS DATED DURING THE PERIOD OF WILLIAM
SHAKESPEARES YOUTH HAS BEEN SCRUTINIZED OVER HALF A DOZEN SHIRES AND
NOT ONE SIGNATURE OF THE YOUNG MAN HAS BEEN FOUND

MOREOVER IF SHAKESPEARE HAD SERVED AS CLERK IN AN ATTORNEYS OFFICE IT
IS CLEAR THAT HE MUST HAVE SO SERVED FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD IN ORDER
TO HAVE GAINED IF INDEED IT IS CREDIBLE THAT HE COULD HAVE SO
GAINED HIS REMARKABLE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW CAN WE THEN FOR A MOMENT
BELIEVE THAT IF THIS HAD BEEN SO TRADITION WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY
SILENT ON THE MATTER THAT DOWDALLS OLD CLERK OVER EIGHTY YEARS OF
AGE SHOULD HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT THOUGH HE WAS SURE ENOUGH ABOUT THE
BUTCHERS APPRENTICE AND THAT ALL THE OTHER ANCIENT WITNESSES SHOULD
BE IN SIMILAR IGNORANCE

BUT SUCH ARE THE METHODS OF STRATFORDIAN CONTROVERSY TRADITION IS TO
BE SCOUTED WHEN IT IS FOUND INCONVENIENT BUT CITED AS IRREFRAGABLE
TRUTH WHEN IT SUITS THE CASE SHAKESPEARE OF STRATFORD WAS THE AUTHOR
OF THE PLAYS AND POEMS BUT THE AUTHOR OF THE PLAYS AND POEMS COULD NOT
HAVE BEEN A BUTCHERS APPRENTICE AWAY THEREFORE WITH TRADITION BUT
THE AUTHOR OF THE PLAYS AND POEMS MUST HAVE HAD A VERY LARGE AND A
VERY ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW THEREFORE SHAKESPEARE OF STRATFORD
MUST HAVE BEEN AN ATTORNEYS CLERK THE METHOD IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF BY
SIMILAR REASONING SHAKESPEARE HAS BEEN MADE A COUNTRY SCHOOLMASTER A
SOLDIER A PHYSICIAN A PRINTER AND A GOOD MANY OTHER THINGS BESIDES
ACCORDING TO THE INCLINATION AND THE EXIGENCIES OF THE COMMENTATOR IT
WOULD NOT BE IN THE LEAST SURPRISING TO FIND THAT HE WAS STUDYING LATIN
AS A SCHOOLMASTER AND LAW IN AN ATTORNEYS OFFICE AT THE SAME TIME

HOWEVER WE MUST DO MR COLLINS THE JUSTICE OF SAYING THAT HE HAS FULLY
RECOGNIZED WHAT IS INDEED TOLERABLY OBVIOUS THAT SHAKESPEARE MUST
HAVE HAD A SOUND LEGAL TRAINING IT MAY OF COURSE BE URGED HE
WRITES THAT SHAKESPEARES KNOWLEDGE OF MEDICINE AND PARTICULARLY
THAT BRANCH OF IT WHICH RELATED TO MORBID PSYCHOLOGY IS EQUALLY
REMARKABLE AND THAT NO ONE HAS EVER CONTENDED THAT HE WAS A PHYSICIAN
HERE MR COLLINS IS WRONG THAT CONTENTION ALSO HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD
IT MAY BE URGED THAT HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE TECHNICALITIES OF OTHER
CRAFTS AND CALLINGS NOTABLY OF MARINE AND MILITARY AFFAIRS WAS ALSO
EXTRAORDINARY AND YET NO ONE HAS SUSPECTED HIM OF BEING A SAILOR OR A
SOLDIER WRONG AGAIN WHY EVEN MESSRS GARNETT AND GOSSE SUSPECT
THAT HE WAS A SOLDIER THIS MAY BE CONCEDED BUT THE CONCESSION HARDLY
FURNISHES AN ANALOGY TO THESE AND ALL OTHER SUBJECTS HE RECURS
OCCASIONALLY AND IN SEASON BUT WITH REMINISCENCES OF THE LAW HIS
MEMORY AS IS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR WAS SIMPLY SATURATED IN SEASON AND OUT
OF SEASON NOW IN MANIFEST NOW IN RECONDITE APPLICATION HE PRESSES IT
INTO THE SERVICE OF EXPRESSION AND ILLUSTRATION AT LEAST A THIRD OF
HIS MYRIAD METAPHORS ARE DERIVED FROM IT IT WOULD INDEED BE DIFFICULT
TO FIND A SINGLE ACT IN ANY OF HIS DRAMAS NAY IN SOME OF THEM A
SINGLE SCENE THE DICTION AND IMAGERY OF WHICH ARE NOT COLORED BY IT
MUCH OF HIS LAW MAY HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FROM THREE BOOKS EASILY
ACCESSIBLE TO HIMNAMELY TOTTELLS PRECEDENTS PULTONS
STATUTES AND FRAUNCES LAWIERS LOGIKE WORKS WITH
WHICH HE CERTAINLY SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR BUT MUCH OF IT COULD
ONLY HAVE COME FROM ONE WHO HAD AN INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS WE QUITE AGREE WITH MR CASTLE THAT SHAKESPEARES LEGAL
KNOWLEDGE IS NOT WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN PICKED UP IN AN ATTORNEYS
OFFICE BUT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN LEARNED BY AN ACTUAL ATTENDANCE AT THE
COURTS AT A PLEADERS CHAMBERS AND ON CIRCUIT OR BY ASSOCIATING
INTIMATELY WITH MEMBERS OF THE BENCH AND BAR

THIS IS EXCELLENT BUT WHAT IS MR COLLINSS EXPLANATION PERHAPS THE
SIMPLEST SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM IS TO ACCEPT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT IN
EARLY LIFE HE WAS IN AN ATTORNEYS OFFICE THAT HE THERE CONTRACTED
A LOVE FOR THE LAW WHICH NEVER LEFT HIM THAT AS A YOUNG MAN IN LONDON
HE CONTINUED TO STUDY OR DABBLE IN IT FOR HIS AMUSEMENT TO STROLL IN
LEISURE HOURS INTO THE COURTS AND TO FREQUENT THE SOCIETY OF LAWYERS
ON NO OTHER SUPPOSITION IS IT POSSIBLE TO EXPLAIN THE ATTRACTION WHICH
THE LAW EVIDENTLY HAD FOR HIM AND HIS MINUTE AND UNDEVIATING ACCURACY
IN A SUBJECT WHERE NO LAYMAN WHO HAS INDULGED IN SUCH COPIOUS AND
OSTENTATIOUS DISPLAY OF LEGAL TECHNICALITIES HAS EVER YET SUCCEEDED IN
KEEPING HIMSELF FROM TRIPPING

A LAME CONCLUSION NO OTHER SUPPOSITION INDEED YES THERE IS
ANOTHER AND A VERY OBVIOUS SUPPOSITIONNAMELY THAT SHAKESPEARE WAS
HIMSELF A LAWYER WELL VERSED IN HIS TRADE VERSED IN ALL THE WAYS OF
THE COURTS AND LIVING IN CLOSE INTIMACY WITH JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE
INNS OF COURT

ONE IS OF COURSE THANKFUL THAT MR COLLINS HAS APPRECIATED THE FACT
THAT SHAKESPEARE MUST HAVE HAD A SOUND LEGAL TRAINING BUT I MAY BE
FORGIVEN IF I DO NOT ATTACH QUITE SO MUCH IMPORTANCE TO HIS
PRONOUNCEMENTS ON THIS BRANCH OF THE SUBJECT AS TO THOSE OF MALONE
LORD CAMPBELL JUDGE HOLMES MR CASTLE KC LORD PENZANCE MR GRANT
WHITE AND OTHER LAWYERS WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR OPINION ON THE
MATTER OF SHAKESPEARES LEGAL ACQUIREMENTS

HERE IT MAY PERHAPS BE WORTH WHILE TO QUOTE AGAIN FROM LORD
PENZANCES BOOK AS TO THE SUGGESTION THAT SHAKESPEARE HAD SOMEHOW OR
OTHER MANAGED TO ACQUIRE A PERFECT FAMILIARITY WITH LEGAL PRINCIPLES
AND AN ACCURATE AND READY USE OF THE TECHNICAL TERMS AND PHRASES NOT
ONLY OF THE CONVEYANCERS OFFICE BUT OF THE PLEADERS CHAMBERS AND THE
COURTS AT WESTMINSTER THIS AS LORD PENZANCE POINTS OUT WOULD
REQUIRE NOTHING SHORT OF EMPLOYMENT IN SOME CAREER INVOLVING CONSTANT
CONTACT WITH LEGAL QUESTIONS AND GENERAL LEGAL WORK BUT IN WHAT
PORTION OF SHAKESPEARES CAREER WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO POINT OUT THAT
TIME COULD BE FOUND FOR THE INTERPOSITION OF A LEGAL EMPLOYMENT IN THE
CHAMBERS OR OFFICES OF PRACTICING LAWYERS IT IS BEYOND DOUBT THAT
AT AN EARLY PERIOD HE WAS CALLED UPON TO ABANDON HIS ATTENDANCE AT
SCHOOL AND ASSIST HIS FATHER AND WAS SOON AFTER AT THE AGE OF
SIXTEEN BOUND APPRENTICE TO A TRADE WHILE UNDER THE OBLIGATION OF
THIS BOND HE COULD NOT HAVE PURSUED ANY OTHER EMPLOYMENT THEN HE
LEAVES STRATFORD AND COMES TO LONDON HE HAS TO PROVIDE HIMSELF WITH
THE MEANS OF A LIVELIHOOD AND THIS HE DID IN SOME CAPACITY AT THE
THEATER NO ONE DOUBTS THAT THE HOLDING OF HORSES IS SCOUTED BY MANY
AND PERHAPS WITH JUSTICE AS BEING UNLIKELY AND CERTAINLY UNPROVED BUT
WHATEVER THE NATURE OF HIS EMPLOYMENT WAS AT THE THEATER THERE IS
HARDLY ROOM FOR THE BELIEF THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN OTHER THAN
CONTINUOUS FOR HIS PROGRESS THERE WAS SO RAPID ERE LONG HE HAD BEEN
TAKEN INTO THE COMPANY AS AN ACTOR AND WAS SOON SPOKEN OF AS A
JOHANNES FACTOTUM HIS RAPID ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH SPEAKS VOLUMES
FOR THE CONSTANCY AND ACTIVITY OF HIS SERVICES ONE FAILS TO SEE WHEN
THERE COULD BE A BREAK IN THE CURRENT OF HIS LIFE AT THIS PERIOD OF IT
GIVING ROOM OR OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGAL OR INDEED ANY OTHER EMPLOYMENT
IN SAYS KNIGHT WE HAVE UNDENIABLE EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD NOT
ONLY A CASUAL ENGAGEMENT WAS NOT ONLY A SALARIED SERVANT AS MANY
PLAYERS WERE BUT WAS A SHAREHOLDER IN THE COMPANY OF THE QUEENS
PLAYERS WITH OTHER SHAREHOLDERS BELOW HIM ON THE LIST THIS
WOULD BE WITHIN TWO YEARS AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN LONDON WHICH IS PLACED
BY WHITE AND HALLIWELL PHILLIPPS ABOUT THE YEAR THE DIFFICULTY
IN SUPPOSING THAT STARTING WITH A STATE OF IGNORANCE IN WHEN HE
IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE COME TO LONDON HE WAS INDUCED TO ENTER UPON A
COURSE OF MOST EXTENDED STUDY AND MENTAL CULTURE IS ALMOST
INSUPERABLE STILL IT WAS PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT HE
COULD HAVE HAD ACCESS TO THE NEEDFUL BOOKS BUT THIS LEGAL TRAINING
SEEMS TO ME TO STAND ON A DIFFERENT FOOTING IT IS NOT ONLY
UNACCOUNTABLE AND INCREDIBLE BUT IT IS ACTUALLY NEGATIVED BY THE KNOWN
FACTS OF HIS CAREER LORD PENZANCE THEN REFERS TO THE FACT THAT BY
ACCORDING TO THE BEST AUTHORITY MR GRANT WHITE SEVERAL OF THE
PLAYS HAD BEEN WRITTEN THE COMEDY OF ERRORS IN LOVES
LABOURS LOST IN TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA IN OR AND
SO FORTH AND THEN ASKS WITH THIS CATALOGUE OF DRAMATIC WORK ON
HAND WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE COULD HAVE TAKEN A LEADING PART IN THE
MANAGEMENT AND CONDUCT OF TWO THEATERS AND IF MR PHILLIPPS IS TO BE
RELIED UPON TAKEN HIS SHARE IN THE PERFORMANCES OF THE PROVINCIAL
TOURS OF HIS COMPANYAND AT THE SAME TIME DEVOTED HIMSELF TO THE STUDY
OF THE LAW IN ALL ITS BRANCHES SO EFFICIENTLY AS TO MAKE HIMSELF
COMPLETE MASTER OF ITS PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE AND SATURATE HIS MIND
WITH ALL ITS MOST TECHNICAL TERMS

I HAVE CITED THIS PASSAGE FROM LORD PENZANCES BOOK BECAUSE IT LAY
BEFORE ME AND I HAD ALREADY QUOTED FROM IT ON THE MATTER OF
SHAKESPEARES LEGAL KNOWLEDGE BUT OTHER WRITERS HAVE STILL BETTER SET
FORTH THE INSUPERABLE DIFFICULTIES AS THEY SEEM TO ME WHICH BESET THE
IDEA THAT SHAKESPEARE MIGHT HAVE FOUND TIME IN SOME UNKNOWN PERIOD OF
EARLY LIFE AMID MULTIFARIOUS OTHER OCCUPATIONS FOR THE STUDY OF
CLASSICS LITERATURE AND LAW TO SAY NOTHING OF LANGUAGES AND A FEW
OTHER MATTERS LORD PENZANCE FURTHER ASKS HIS READERS DID YOU EVER
MEET WITH OR HEAR OF AN INSTANCE IN WHICH A YOUNG MAN IN THIS COUNTRY
GAVE HIMSELF UP TO LEGAL STUDIES AND ENGAGED IN LEGAL EMPLOYMENTS
WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY OF BECOMING FAMILIAR WITH THE TECHNICALITIES OF
PRACTICE UNLESS WITH THE VIEW OF PRACTICING IN THAT PROFESSION I DO
NOT BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE EASY OR INDEED POSSIBLE TO PRODUCE AN
INSTANCE IN WHICH THE LAW HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY STUDIED IN ALL ITS
BRANCHES EXCEPT AS A QUALIFICATION FOR PRACTICE IN THE LEGAL
PROFESSION

THIS TESTIMONY IS SO STRONG SO DIRECT SO AUTHORITATIVE AND SO
UNCHEAPENED UNWATERED BY GUESSES AND SURMISES AND MAYBESOS AND
MIGHTHAVEBEENS AND COULDHAVEBEENS AND MUSTHAVEBEENS AND THE
REST OF THAT TON OF PLASTER OF PARIS OUT OF WHICH THE BIOGRAPHERS HAVE
BUILT THE COLOSSAL BRONTOSAUR WHICH GOES BY THE STRATFORD ACTORS NAME
THAT IT QUITE CONVINCES ME THAT THE MAN WHO WROTE SHAKESPEARES WORKS
KNEW ALL ABOUT LAW AND LAWYERS ALSO THAT THAT MAN COULD NOT HAVE BEEN
THE STRATFORD SHAKESPEAREAND WASNT

WHO DID WRITE THESE WORKS THEN

I WISH I KNEW

IX

DID FRANCIS BACON WRITE SHAKESPEARES WORKS NOBODY KNOWS

WE CANNOT SAY WE KNOW A THING WHEN THAT THING HAS NOT BEEN PROVED
KNOW IS TOO STRONG A WORD TO USE WHEN THE EVIDENCE IS NOT FINAL AND
ABSOLUTELY CONCLUSIVE WE CAN INFER IF WE WANT TO LIKE THOSE
SLAVES NO I WILL NOT WRITE THAT WORD IT IS NOT KIND IT IS NOT
COURTEOUS THE UPHOLDERS OF THE STRATFORDSHAKESPEARE SUPERSTITION CALL
US THE HARDEST NAMES THEY CAN THINK OF AND THEY KEEP DOING IT ALL
THE TIME VERY WELL IF THEY LIKE TO DESCEND TO THAT LEVEL LET THEM DO
IT BUT I WILL NOT SO UNDIGNIFY MYSELF AS TO FOLLOW THEM I CANNOT CALL
THEM HARSH NAMES THE MOST I CAN DO IS TO INDICATE THEM BY TERMS
REFLECTING MY DISAPPROVAL AND THIS WITHOUT MALICE WITHOUT VENOM

TO RESUME WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO SAY WAS THOSE THUGS HAVE BUILT THEIR
ENTIRE SUPERSTITION UPON INFERENCES NOT UPON KNOWN AND ESTABLISHED
FACTS IT IS A WEAK METHOD AND POOR AND I AM GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SAY
OUR SIDE NEVER RESORTS TO IT WHILE THERE IS ANYTHING ELSE TO RESORT TO

BUT WHEN WE MUST WE MUST AND WE HAVE NOW ARRIVED AT A PLACE OF THAT
SORT SINCE THE STRATFORD SHAKESPEARE COULDNT HAVE WRITTEN THE
WORKS WE INFER THAT SOMEBODY DID WHO WAS IT THEN THIS REQUIRES SOME
MORE INFERRING

ORDINARILY WHEN AN UNSIGNED POEM SWEEPS ACROSS THE CONTINENT LIKE A
TIDAL WAVE WHOSE ROAR AND BOOM AND THUNDER ARE MADE UP OF ADMIRATION
DELIGHT AND APPLAUSE A DOZEN OBSCURE PEOPLE RISE UP AND CLAIM THE
AUTHORSHIP WHY A DOZEN INSTEAD OF ONLY ONE OR TWO ONE REASON IS
BECAUSE THERE ARE A DOZEN THAT ARE RECOGNIZABLY COMPETENT TO DO THAT
POEM DO YOU REMEMBER BEAUTIFUL SNOW DO YOU REMEMBER ROCK ME TO
SLEEP MOTHER ROCK ME TO SLEEP DO YOU REMEMBER BACKWARD TURN
BACKWARD O TIME IN THY FLIGHT MAKE ME A CHILD AGAIN JUST FOR
TONIGHT I REMEMBER THEM VERY WELL THEIR AUTHORSHIP WAS CLAIMED BY
MOST OF THE GROWNUP PEOPLE WHO WERE ALIVE AT THE TIME AND EVERY
CLAIMANT HAD ONE PLAUSIBLE ARGUMENT IN HIS FAVOR AT LEASTTO WIT HE
COULD HAVE DONE THE AUTHORING HE WAS COMPETENT

HAVE THE WORKS BEEN CLAIMED BY A DOZEN THEY HAVENT THERE WAS GOOD
REASON THE WORLD KNOWS THERE WAS BUT ONE MAN ON THE PLANET AT THE TIME
WHO WAS COMPETENTNOT A DOZEN AND NOT TWO A LONG TIME AGO THE
DWELLERS IN A FAR COUNTRY USED NOW AND THEN TO FIND A PROCESSION OF
PRODIGIOUS FOOTPRINTS STRETCHING ACROSS THE PLAINFOOTPRINTS THAT WERE
THREE MILES APART EACH FOOTPRINT A THIRD OF A MILE LONG AND A FURLONG
DEEP AND WITH FORESTS AND VILLAGES MASHED TO MUSH IN IT WAS THERE ANY
DOUBT AS TO WHO MADE THAT MIGHTY TRAIL WERE THERE A DOZEN CLAIMANTS
WHERE THERE TWO NOTHE PEOPLE KNEW WHO IT WAS THAT HAD BEEN ALONG
THERE THERE WAS ONLY ONE HERCULES

THERE HAS BEEN ONLY ONE SHAKESPEARE THERE COULDNT BE TWO CERTAINLY
THERE COULDNT BE TWO AT THE SAME TIME IT TAKES AGES TO BRING FORTH A
SHAKESPEARE AND SOME MORE AGES TO MATCH HIM THIS ONE WAS NOT MATCHED
BEFORE HIS TIME NOR DURING HIS TIME AND HASNT BEEN MATCHED SINCE
THE PROSPECT OF MATCHING HIM IN OUR TIME IS NOT BRIGHT

THE BACONIANS CLAIM THAT THE STRATFORD SHAKESPEARE WAS NOT QUALIFIED TO
WRITE THE WORKS AND THAT FRANCIS BACON WAS THEY CLAIM THAT BACON
POSSESSED THE STUPENDOUS EQUIPMENTBOTH NATURAL AND ACQUIREDFOR THE
MIRACLE AND THAT NO OTHER ENGLISHMAN OF HIS DAY POSSESSED THE LIKE
OR INDEED ANYTHING CLOSELY APPROACHING IT

MACAULAY IN HIS ESSAY HAS MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THE SPLENDOR AND
HORIZONLESS MAGNITUDE OF THAT EQUIPMENT ALSO HE HAS SYNOPSIZED
BACONS HISTORYA THING WHICH CANNOT BE DONE FOR THE STRATFORD
SHAKESPEARE FOR HE HASNT ANY HISTORY TO SYNOPSIZE BACONS HISTORY IS
OPEN TO THE WORLD FROM HIS BOYHOOD TO HIS DEATH IN OLD AGEA HISTORY
CONSISTING OF KNOWN FACTS DISPLAYED IN MINUTE AND MULTITUDINOUS
DETAIL FACTS NOT GUESSES AND CONJECTURES AND MIGHTHAVEBEENS

WHEREBY IT APPEARS THAT HE WAS BORN OF A RACE OF STATESMEN AND HAD A
LORD CHANCELLOR FOR HIS FATHER AND A MOTHER WHO WAS DISTINGUISHED
BOTH AS A LINGUIST AND A THEOLOGIAN SHE CORRESPONDED IN GREEK WITH
BISHOP JEWELL AND TRANSLATED HIS APOLOGIA FROM THE LATIN SO
CORRECTLY THAT NEITHER HE NOR ARCHBISHOP PARKER COULD SUGGEST A SINGLE
ALTERATION IT IS THE ATMOSPHERE WE ARE REARED IN THAT DETERMINES HOW
OUR INCLINATIONS AND ASPIRATIONS SHALL TEND THE ATMOSPHERE FURNISHED
BY THE PARENTS TO THE SON IN THIS PRESENT CASE WAS AN ATMOSPHERE
SATURATED WITH LEARNING WITH THINKINGS AND PONDERINGS UPON DEEP
SUBJECTS AND WITH POLITE CULTURE IT HAD ITS NATURAL EFFECT
SHAKESPEARE OF STRATFORD WAS REARED IN A HOUSE WHICH HAD NO USE FOR
BOOKS SINCE ITS OWNERS HIS PARENTS WERE WITHOUT EDUCATION THIS MAY
HAVE HAD AN EFFECT UPON THE SON BUT WE DO NOT KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE NO
HISTORY OF HIM OF AN INFORMING SORT THERE WERE BUT FEW BOOKS ANYWHERE
IN THAT DAY AND ONLY THE WELLTODO AND HIGHLY EDUCATED POSSESSED
THEM THEY BEING ALMOST CONFINED TO THE DEAD LANGUAGES ALL THE
VALUABLE BOOKS THEN EXTANT IN ALL THE VERNACULAR DIALECTS OF EUROPE
WOULD HARDLY HAVE FILLED A SINGLE SHELFIMAGINE IT THE FEW EXISTING
BOOKS WERE IN THE LATIN TONGUE MAINLY A PERSON WHO WAS IGNORANT OF IT
WAS SHUT OUT FROM ALL ACQUAINTANCENOT MERELY WITH CICERO AND VIRGIL
BUT WITH THE MOST INTERESTING MEMOIRS STATE PAPERS AND PAMPHLETS OF
HIS OWN TIMEA LITERATURE NECESSARY TO THE STRATFORD LAD FOR HIS
FICTITIOUS REPUTATIONS SAKE SINCE THE WRITER OF HIS WORKS WOULD BEGIN
TO USE IT WHOLESALE AND IN A MOST MASTERLY WAY BEFORE THE LAD WAS
HARDLY MORE THAN OUT OF HIS TEENS AND INTO HIS TWENTIES

AT FIFTEEN BACON WAS SENT TO THE UNIVERSITY AND HE SPENT THREE YEARS
THERE THENCE HE WENT TO PARIS IN THE TRAIN OF THE ENGLISH AMBASSADOR
AND THERE HE MINGLED DAILY WITH THE WISE THE CULTURED THE GREAT AND
THE ARISTOCRACY OF FASHION DURING ANOTHER THREE YEARS A TOTAL OF SIX
YEARS SPENT AT THE SOURCES OF KNOWLEDGE KNOWLEDGE BOTH OF BOOKS AND OF
MEN THE THREE SPENT AT THE UNIVERSITY WERE COEVAL WITH THE SECOND AND
LAST THREE SPENT BY THE LITTLE STRATFORD LAD AT STRATFORD SCHOOL
SUPPOSEDLY AND PERHAPSEDLY AND MAYBE AND BY INFERENCEWITH NOTHING
TO INFER FROM THE SECOND THREE OF THE BACONIAN SIX WERE PRESUMABLY
SPENT BY THE STRATFORD LAD AS APPRENTICE TO A BUTCHER THAT IS THE
THUGS PRESUME ITON NO EVIDENCE OF ANY KIND WHICH IS THEIR WAY WHEN
THEY WANT A HISTORICAL FACT FACT AND PRESUMPTION ARE FOR BUSINESS
PURPOSES ALL THE SAME TO THEM THEY KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BUT THEY ALSO
KNOW HOW TO BLINK IT THEY KNOW TOO THAT WHILE IN HISTORYBUILDING A
FACT IS BETTER THAN A PRESUMPTION IT DOESNT TAKE A PRESUMPTION LONG
TO BLOOM INTO A FACT WHEN THEY HAVE THE HANDLING OF IT THEY KNOW BY
OLD EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN THEY GET HOLD OF A PRESUMPTIONTADPOLE HE IS
NOT GOING TO STAY TADPOLE IN THEIR HISTORYTANK NO THEY KNOW HOW TO
DEVELOP HIM INTO THE GIANT FOURLEGGED BULLFROG OF FACT AND MAKE HIM
SIT UP ON HIS HAMS AND PUFF OUT HIS CHIN AND LOOK IMPORTANT AND
INSOLENT AND COMETOSTAY AND ASSERT HIS GENUINE SIMONPURE
AUTHENTICITY WITH A THUNDERING BELLOW THAT WILL CONVINCE EVERYBODY
BECAUSE IT IS SO LOUD THE THUG IS AWARE THAT LOUDNESS CONVINCES SIXTY
PERSONS WHERE REASONING CONVINCES BUT ONE I WOULDNT BE A THUG NOT
EVEN IFBUT NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE
ARGUMENT AND IT IS NOT NOBLE IN SPIRIT BESIDES IF I AM BETTER THAN A
THUG IS THE MERIT MINE NO IT IS HIS THEN TO HIM BE THE PRAISE THAT
IS THE RIGHT SPIRIT

THEY PRESUME THE LAD SEVERED HIS PRESUMED CONNECTION WITH THE
STRATFORD SCHOOL TO BECOME APPRENTICE TO A BUTCHER THEY ALSO PRESUME
THAT THE BUTCHER WAS HIS FATHER THEY DONT KNOW THERE IS NO WRITTEN
RECORD OF IT NOR ANY OTHER ACTUAL EVIDENCE IF IT WOULD HAVE HELPED
THEIR CASE ANY THEY WOULD HAVE APPRENTICED HIM TO THIRTY BUTCHERS TO
FIFTY BUTCHERS TO A WILDERNESS OF BUTCHERSALL BY THEIR PATENTED
METHOD PRESUMPTION IF IT WILL HELP THEIR CASE THEY WILL DO IT YET
AND IF IT WILL FURTHER HELP IT THEY WILL PRESUME THAT ALL THOSE
BUTCHERS WERE HIS FATHER AND THE WEEK AFTER THEY WILL SAY IT WHY
IT IS JUST LIKE BEING THE PAST TENSE OF THE COMPOUND REFLEXIVE
ADVERBIAL INCANDESCENT HYPODERMIC IRREGULAR ACCUSATIVE NOUN OF
MULTITUDE WHICH IS FATHER TO THE EXPRESSION WHICH THE GRAMMARIANS CALL
VERB IT IS LIKE A WHOLE ANCESTRY WITH ONLY ONE POSTERITY

TO RESUME NEXT THE YOUNG BACON TOOK UP THE STUDY OF LAW AND MASTERED
THAT ABSTRUSE SCIENCE FROM THAT DAY TO THE END OF HIS LIFE HE WAS
DAILY IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH LAWYERS AND JUDGES NOT AS A CASUAL
ONLOOKER IN INTERVALS BETWEEN HOLDING HORSES IN FRONT OF A THEATER BUT
AS A PRACTICING LAWYERA GREAT AND SUCCESSFUL ONE A RENOWNED ONE A
LAUNCELOT OF THE BAR THE MOST FORMIDABLE LANCE IN THE HIGH BROTHERHOOD
OF THE LEGAL TABLE ROUND HE LIVED IN THE LAWS ATMOSPHERE THENCEFORTH
ALL HIS YEARS AND BY SHEER ABILITY FORCED HIS WAY UP ITS DIFFICULT
STEEPS TO ITS SUPREMEST SUMMIT THE LORDCHANCELLORSHIP LEAVING BEHIND
HIM NO FELLOWCRAFTSMAN QUALIFIED TO CHALLENGE HIS DIVINE RIGHT TO THAT
MAJESTIC PLACE

WHEN WE READ THE PRAISES BESTOWED BY LORD PENZANCE AND THE OTHER
ILLUSTRIOUS EXPERTS UPON THE LEGAL CONDITION AND LEGAL APTNESSES
BRILLIANCES PROFUNDITIES AND FELICITIES SO PRODIGALLY DISPLAYED IN
THE PLAYS AND TRY TO FIT THEM TO THE HISTORYLESS STRATFORD
STAGEMANAGER THEY SOUND WILD STRANGE INCREDIBLE LUDICROUS BUT
WHEN WE PUT THEM IN THE MOUTH OF BACON THEY DO NOT SOUND STRANGE THEY
SEEM IN THEIR NATURAL AND RIGHTFUL PLACE THEY SEEM AT HOME THERE
PLEASE TURN BACK AND READ THEM AGAIN ATTRIBUTED TO SHAKESPEARE OF
STRATFORD THEY ARE MEANINGLESS THEY ARE INEBRIATE
EXTRAVAGANCIESINTEMPERATE ADMIRATIONS OF THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON SO
TO SPEAK ATTRIBUTED TO BACON THEY ARE ADMIRATIONS OF THE GOLDEN
GLORIES OF THE MOONS FRONT SIDE THE MOON AT THE FULLAND NOT
INTEMPERATE NOT OVERWROUGHT BUT SANE AND RIGHT AND JUSTIFIED AT
EVERY TURN AND POINT AT WHICH THE AUTHOR REQUIRED A METAPHOR SIMILE
OR ILLUSTRATION HIS MIND EVER TURNED FIRST TO THE LAW HE SEEMS
ALMOST TO HAVE THOUGHT IN LEGAL PHRASES THE COMMONEST LEGAL PHRASES
THE COMMONEST OF LEGAL EXPRESSIONS WERE EVER AT THE END OF HIS PEN
THAT COULD HAPPEN TO NO ONE BUT A PERSON WHOSE TRADE WAS THE LAW IT
COULD NOT HAPPEN TO A DABBLER IN IT VETERAN MARINERS FILL THEIR
CONVERSATION WITH SAILORPHRASES AND DRAW ALL THEIR SIMILES FROM THE
SHIP AND THE SEA AND THE STORM BUT NO MERE PASSENGER EVER DOES IT
BE HE OF STRATFORD OR ELSEWHERE OR COULD DO IT WITH ANYTHING
RESEMBLING ACCURACY IF HE WERE HARDY ENOUGH TO TRY PLEASE READ AGAIN
WHAT LORD CAMPBELL AND THE OTHER GREAT AUTHORITIES HAVE SAID ABOUT
BACON WHEN THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE SAYING IT ABOUT SHAKESPEARE OF
STRATFORD

X

THE REST OF THE EQUIPMENT

THE AUTHOR OF THE PLAYS WAS EQUIPPED BEYOND EVERY OTHER MAN OF HIS
TIME WITH WISDOM ERUDITION IMAGINATION CAPACIOUSNESS OF MIND
GRACE AND MAJESTY OF EXPRESSION EVERY ONE HAS SAID IT NO ONE DOUBTS
IT ALSO HE HAD HUMOR HUMOR IN RICH ABUNDANCE AND ALWAYS WANTING TO
BREAK OUT WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE OF ANY KIND THAT SHAKESPEARE OF
STRATFORD POSSESSED ANY OF THESE GIFTS OR ANY OF THESE ACQUIREMENTS
THE ONLY LINES HE EVER WROTE SO FAR AS WE KNOW ARE SUBSTANTIALLY
BARREN OF THEMBARREN OF ALL OF THEM

GOOD FRIEND FOR IESUS SAKE FORBEARE
TO DIGG THE DUST ENCLOASED HEARE
BLEST BE YE MAN YT SPARES THES STONES
AND CURST BE HE YT MOVES MY BONES


BEN JONSON SAYS OF BACON AS ORATOR

HIS LANGUAGE WHERE HE COULD SPARE AND PASS BY A JEST WAS NOBLY
CENSORIOUS NO MAN EVER SPOKE MORE NEATLY MORE PRESSLY MORE
WEIGHTILY OR SUFFERED LESS EMPTINESS LESS IDLENESS IN WHAT HE
UTTERED NO MEMBER OF HIS SPEECH BUT CONSISTED OF HIS ITS OWN
GRACES THE FEAR OF EVERY MAN THAT HEARD HIM WAS LEST HE SHOULD MAKE
AN END


FROM MACAULAY

HE CONTINUED TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF IN PARLIAMENT PARTICULARLY BY HIS
EXERTIONS IN FAVOR OF ONE EXCELLENT MEASURE ON WHICH THE KINGS HEART
WAS SETTHE UNION OF ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR
SUCH AN INTELLECT TO DISCOVER MANY IRRESISTIBLE ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF
SUCH A SCHEME HE CONDUCTED THE GREAT CASE OF THE POST NATI IN THE
EXCHEQUER CHAMBER AND THE DECISION OF THE JUDGESA DECISION THE
LEGALITY OF WHICH MAY BE QUESTIONED BUT THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF WHICH
MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGEDWAS IN A GREAT MEASURE ATTRIBUTED TO HIS DEXTEROUS
MANAGEMENT


AGAIN


WHILE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS AND IN THE COURTS OF
LAW HE STILL FOUND LEISURE FOR LETTERS AND PHILOSOPHY THE NOBLE
TREATISE ON THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING WHICH AT A LATER PERIOD WAS
EXPANDED INTO THE DE AUGMENTIS APPEARED IN

THE WISDOM OF THE ANCIENTS A WORK WHICH IF IT HAD PROCEEDED FROM
ANY OTHER WRITER WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS A MASTERPIECE OF WIT
AND LEARNING WAS PRINTED IN

IN THE MEAN TIME THE NOVUM ORGANUM WAS SLOWLY PROCEEDING SEVERAL
DISTINGUISHED MEN OF LEARNING HAD BEEN PERMITTED TO SEE PORTIONS OF
THAT EXTRAORDINARY BOOK AND THEY SPOKE WITH THE GREATEST ADMIRATION OF
HIS GENIUS

EVEN SIR THOMAS BODLEY AFTER PERUSING THE COGITATA ET VISA ONE OF
THE MOST PRECIOUS OF THOSE SCATTERED LEAVES OUT OF WHICH THE GREAT
ORACULAR VOLUME WAS AFTERWARD MADE UP ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IN ALL
PROPOSALS AND PLOTS IN THAT BOOK BACON SHOWED HIMSELF A MASTER
WORKMAN AND THAT IT COULD NOT BE GAINSAID BUT ALL THE TREATISE OVER
DID ABOUND WITH CHOICE CONCEITS OF THE PRESENT STATE OF LEARNING AND
WITH WORTHY CONTEMPLATIONS OF THE MEANS TO PROCURE IT

IN A NEW EDITION OF THE ESSAYS APPEARED WITH ADDITIONS
SURPASSING THE ORIGINAL COLLECTION BOTH IN BULK AND QUALITY

NOR DID THESE PURSUITS DISTRACT BACONS ATTENTION FROM A WORK THE MOST
ARDUOUS THE MOST GLORIOUS AND THE MOST USEFUL THAT EVEN HIS MIGHTY
POWERS COULD HAVE ACHIEVED THE REDUCING AND RECOMPILING TO USE HIS
OWN PHRASE OF THE LAWS OF ENGLAND


TO SERVE THE EXACTING AND LABORIOUS OFFICES OF ATTORNEYGENERAL AND
SOLICITORGENERAL WOULD HAVE SATISFIED THE APPETITE OF ANY OTHER MAN
FOR HARD WORK BUT BACON HAD TO ADD THE VAST LITERARY INDUSTRIES JUST
DESCRIBED TO SATISFY HIS HE WAS A BORN WORKER


THE SERVICE WHICH HE RENDERED TO LETTERS DURING THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF
HIS LIFE AMID TEN THOUSAND DISTRACTIONS AND VEXATIONS INCREASE THE
REGRET WITH WHICH WE THINK ON THE MANY YEARS WHICH HE HAD WASTED TO
USE THE WORDS OF SIR THOMAS BODLEY ON SUCH STUDY AS WAS NOT WORTHY
SUCH A STUDENT

HE COMMENCED A DIGEST OF THE LAWS OF ENGLAND A HISTORY OF ENGLAND
UNDER THE PRINCES OF THE HOUSE OF TUDOR A BODY OF NATIONAL HISTORY A
PHILOSOPHICAL ROMANCE HE MADE EXTENSIVE AND VALUABLE ADDITIONS TO HIS
ESSAYS HE PUBLISHED THE INESTIMABLE TREATISE DE AUGMENTIS
SCIENTIARUM


DID THESE LABORS OF HERCULES FILL UP HIS TIME TO HIS CONTENTMENT AND
QUIET HIS APPETITE FOR WORK NOT ENTIRELY

THE TRIFLES WITH WHICH HE AMUSED HIMSELF IN HOURS OF PAIN AND LANGUOR
BORE THE MARK OF HIS MIND THE BEST JESTBOOK IN THE WORLD IS THAT
WHICH HE DICTATED FROM MEMORY WITHOUT REFERRING TO ANY BOOK ON A DAY
ON WHICH ILLNESS HAD RENDERED HIM INCAPABLE OF SERIOUS STUDY


HERE ARE SOME SCATTERED REMARKS FROM MACAULAY WHICH THROW LIGHT UPON
BACON AND SEEM TO INDICATEAND MAYBE DEMONSTRATETHAT HE WAS COMPETENT
TO WRITE THE PLAYS AND POEMS


WITH GREAT MINUTENESS OF OBSERVATION HE HAD AN AMPLITUDE OF
COMPREHENSION SUCH AS HAS NEVER YET BEEN VOUCHSAFED TO ANY OTHER HUMAN
BEING

THE ESSAYS CONTAIN ABUNDANT PROOFS THAT NO NICE FEATURE OF CHARACTER
NO PECULIARITY IN THE ORDERING OF A HOUSE A GARDEN OR A COURTMASQUE
COULD ESCAPE THE NOTICE OF ONE WHOSE MIND WAS CAPABLE OF TAKING IN THE
WHOLE WORLD OF KNOWLEDGE

HIS UNDERSTANDING RESEMBLED THE TENT WHICH THE FAIRY PARIBANOU GAVE TO
PRINCE AHMED FOLD IT AND IT SEEMED A TOY FOR THE HAND OF A LADY
SPREAD IT AND THE ARMIES OF THE POWERFUL SULTANS MIGHT REPOSE BENEATH
ITS SHADE

THE KNOWLEDGE IN WHICH BACON EXCELLED ALL MEN WAS A KNOWLEDGE OF THE
MUTUAL RELATIONS OF ALL DEPARTMENTS OF KNOWLEDGE

IN A LETTER WRITTEN WHEN HE WAS ONLY THIRTYONE TO HIS UNCLE LORD
BURLEIGH HE SAID I HAVE TAKEN ALL KNOWLEDGE TO BE MY PROVINCE

THOUGH BACON DID NOT ARM HIS PHILOSOPHY WITH THE WEAPONS OF LOGIC HE
ADORNED HER PROFUSELY WITH ALL THE RICHEST DECORATIONS OF RHETORIC

THE PRACTICAL FACULTY WAS POWERFUL IN BACON BUT NOT LIKE HIS WIT SO
POWERFUL AS OCCASIONALLY TO USURP THE PLACE OF HIS REASON AND TO
TYRANNIZE OVER THE WHOLE MAN


THERE ARE TOO MANY PLACES IN THE PLAYS WHERE THIS HAPPENS POOR OLD
DYING JOHN OF GAUNT VOLLEYING SECONDRATE PUNS AT HIS OWN NAME IS A
PATHETIC INSTANCE OF IT WE MAY ASSUME THAT IT IS BACONS FAULT BUT
THE STRATFORD SHAKESPEARE HAS TO BEAR THE BLAME


NO IMAGINATION WAS EVER AT ONCE SO STRONG AND SO THOROUGHLY SUBJUGATED
IT STOPPED AT THE FIRST CHECK FROM GOOD SENSE

IN TRUTH MUCH OF BACONS LIFE WAS PASSED IN A VISIONARY WORLDAMID
THINGS AS STRANGE AS ANY THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN THE ARABIAN TALES
AMID BUILDINGS MORE SUMPTUOUS THAN THE PALACE OF ALADDIN FOUNTAINS
MORE WONDERFUL THAN THE GOLDEN WATER OF PARIZADE CONVEYANCES MORE
RAPID THAN THE HIPPOGRYPH OF RUGGIERO ARMS MORE FORMIDABLE THAN THE
LANCE OF ASTOLFO REMEDIES MORE EFFICACIOUS THAN THE BALSAM OF
FIERABRAS YET IN HIS MAGNIFICENT DAYDREAMS THERE WAS NOTHING
WILDNOTHING BUT WHAT SOBER REASON SANCTIONED

BACONS GREATEST PERFORMANCE IS THE FIRST BOOK OF THE NOVUM
ORGANUM EVERY PART OF IT BLAZES WITH WIT BUT WITH WIT WHICH IS
EMPLOYED ONLY TO ILLUSTRATE AND DECORATE TRUTH NO BOOK EVER MADE SO
GREAT A REVOLUTION IN THE MODE OF THINKING OVERTHREW SO MAY
PREJUDICES INTRODUCED SO MANY NEW OPINIONS

BUT WHAT WE MOST ADMIRE IS THE VAST CAPACITY OF THAT INTELLECT WHICH
WITHOUT EFFORT TAKES IN AT ONCE ALL THE DOMAINS OF SCIENCEALL THE
PAST THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE ALL THE ERRORS OF TWO THOUSAND YEARS
ALL THE ENCOURAGING SIGNS OF THE PASSING TIMES ALL THE BRIGHT HOPES OF
THE COMING AGE

HE HAD A WONDERFUL TALENT FOR PACKING THOUGHT CLOSE AND RENDERING IT
PORTABLE

HIS ELOQUENCE WOULD ALONE HAVE ENTITLED HIM TO A HIGH RANK IN
LITERATURE


IT IS EVIDENT THAT HE HAD EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE MENTAL GIFTS AND
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THE ACQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SO PRODIGALLY DISPLAYED
IN THE PLAYS AND POEMS AND IN MUCH HIGHER AND RICHER DEGREE THAN ANY
OTHER MAN OF HIS TIME OR OF ANY PREVIOUS TIME HE WAS A GENIUS WITHOUT
A MATE A PRODIGY NOT MATABLE THERE WAS ONLY ONE OF HIM THE PLANET
COULD NOT PRODUCE TWO OF HIM AT ONE BIRTH NOR IN ONE AGE HE COULD
HAVE WRITTEN ANYTHING THAT IS IN THE PLAYS AND POEMS HE COULD HAVE
WRITTEN THIS

THE CLOUDCAPD TOWERS THE GORGEOUS PALACES
THE SOLEMN TEMPLES THE GREAT GLOBE ITSELF
YEA ALL WHICH IT INHERIT SHALL DISSOLVE
AND LIKE AN INSUBSTANTIAL PAGEANT FADED
LEAVE NOT A RACK BEHIND WE ARE SUCH STUFF
AS DREAMS ARE MADE ON AND OUR LITTLE LIFE
IS ROUNDED WITH A SLEEP


ALSO HE COULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS BUT HE REFRAINED

GOOD FRIEND FOR IESUS SAKE FORBEARE
TO DIGG THE DUST ENCLOASED HEARE
BLEST BE YE MAN YT SPARES THES STONES
AND CURST BE HE YT MOVES MY BONES


WHEN A PERSON READS THE NOBLE VERSES ABOUT THE CLOUDCAPD TOWERS HE
OUGHT NOT TO FOLLOW IT IMMEDIATELY WITH GOOD FRIEND FOR IESUS SAKE
FORBEARE BECAUSE HE WILL FIND THE TRANSITION FROM GREAT POETRY TO POOR
PROSE TOO VIOLENT FOR COMFORT IT WILL GIVE HIM A SHOCK YOU NEVER
NOTICE HOW COMMONPLACE AND UNPOETIC GRAVEL IS UNTIL YOU BITE INTO A
LAYER OF IT IN A PIE

XI

AM I TRYING TO CONVINCE ANYBODY THAT SHAKESPEARE DID NOT WRITE
SHAKESPEARES WORKS AH NOW WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR WOULD I BE SO
SOFT AS THAT AFTER HAVING KNOWN THE HUMAN RACE FAMILIARLY FOR NEARLY
SEVENTYFOUR YEARS IT WOULD GRIEVE ME TO KNOW THAT ANY ONE COULD THINK
SO INJURIOUSLY OF ME SO UNCOMPLIMENTARILY SO UNADMIRINGLY OF ME NO
NO I AM AWARE THAT WHEN EVEN THE BRIGHTEST MIND IN OUR WORLD HAS BEEN
TRAINED UP FROM CHILDHOOD IN A SUPERSTITION OF ANY KIND IT WILL NEVER
BE POSSIBLE FOR THAT MIND IN ITS MATURITY TO EXAMINE SINCERELY
DISPASSIONATELY AND CONSCIENTIOUSLY ANY EVIDENCE OR ANY CIRCUMSTANCE
WHICH SHALL SEEM TO CAST A DOUBT UPON THE VALIDITY OF THAT
SUPERSTITION I DOUBT IF I COULD DO IT MYSELF WE ALWAYS GET AT SECOND
HAND OUR NOTIONS ABOUT SYSTEMS OF GOVERNMENT AND HIGH TARIFF AND LOW
TARIFF AND PROHIBITION AND ANTIPROHIBITION AND THE HOLINESS OF PEACE
AND THE GLORIES OF WAR AND CODES OF HONOR AND CODES OF MORALS AND
APPROVAL OF THE DUEL AND DISAPPROVAL OF IT AND OUR BELIEFS CONCERNING
THE NATURE OF CATS AND OUR IDEAS AS TO WHETHER THE MURDER OF HELPLESS
WILD ANIMALS IS BASE OR IS HEROIC AND OUR PREFERENCES IN THE MATTER OF
RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL PARTIES AND OUR ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF THE
SHAKESPEARES AND THE AUTHOR ORTONS AND THE MRS EDDYS WE GET THEM ALL
AT SECOND HAND WE REASON NONE OF THEM OUT FOR OURSELVES IT IS THE WAY
WE ARE MADE IT IS THE WAY WE ARE ALL MADE AND WE CANT HELP IT WE
CANT CHANGE IT AND WHENEVER WE HAVE BEEN FURNISHED A FETISH AND HAVE
BEEN TAUGHT TO BELIEVE IN IT AND LOVE IT AND WORSHIP IT AND REFRAIN
FROM EXAMINING IT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE HOWSOEVER CLEAR AND STRONG
THAT CAN PERSUADE US TO WITHDRAW FROM IT OUR LOYALTY AND OUR DEVOTION
IN MORALS CONDUCT AND BELIEFS WE TAKE THE COLOR OF OUR ENVIRONMENT
AND ASSOCIATIONS AND IT IS A COLOR THAT CAN SAFELY BE WARRANTED TO
WASH WHENEVER WE HAVE BEEN FURNISHED WITH A TAR BABY OSTENSIBLY
STUFFED WITH JEWELS AND WARNED THAT IT WILL BE DISHONORABLE AND
IRREVERENT TO DISEMBOWEL IT AND TEST THE JEWELS WE KEEP OUR
SACRILEGIOUS HANDS OFF IT WE SUBMIT NOT RELUCTANTLY BUT RATHER
GLADLY FOR WE ARE PRIVATELY AFRAID WE SHOULD FIND UPON EXAMINATION
THAT THE JEWELS ARE OF THE SORT THAT ARE MANUFACTURED AT NORTH ADAMS
MASS

I HAVENT ANY IDEA THAT SHAKESPEARE WILL HAVE TO VACATE HIS PEDESTAL
THIS SIDE OF THE YEAR DISBELIEF IN HIM CANNOT COME SWIFTLY
DISBELIEF IN A HEALTHY AND DEEPLYLOVED TAR BABY HAS NEVER BEEN KNOWN
TO DISINTEGRATE SWIFTLY IT IS A VERY SLOW PROCESS IT TOOK SEVERAL
THOUSAND YEARS TO CONVINCE OUR FINE RACEINCLUDING EVERY SPLENDID
INTELLECT IN ITTHAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A WITCH IT HAS TAKEN
SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS TO CONVINCE THE SAME FINE RACEINCLUDING EVERY
SPLENDID INTELLECT IN ITTHAT THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON AS SATAN IT HAS
TAKEN SEVERAL CENTURIES TO REMOVE PERDITION FROM THE PROTESTANT
CHURCHS PROGRAM OF POSTMORTEM ENTERTAINMENTS IT HAS TAKEN A WEARY
LONG TIME TO PERSUADE AMERICAN PRESBYTERIANS TO GIVE UP INFANT
DAMNATION AND TRY TO BEAR IT THE BEST THEY CAN AND IT LOOKS AS IF
THEIR SCOTCH BRETHREN WILL STILL BE BURNING BABIES IN THE EVERLASTING
FIRES WHEN SHAKESPEARE COMES DOWN FROM HIS PERCH

WE ARE THE REASONING RACE WE CANT PROVE IT BY THE ABOVE EXAMPLES AND
WE CANT PROVE IT BY THE MIRACULOUS HISTORIES BUILT BY THOSE
STRATFORDOLATERS OUT OF A HATFUL OF RAGS AND A BARREL OF SAWDUST BUT
THERE IS A PLENTY OF OTHER THINGS WE CAN PROVE IT BY IF I COULD THINK
OF THEM WE ARE THE REASONING RACE AND WHEN WE FIND A VAGUE FILE OF
CHIPMUNKTRACKS STRINGING THROUGH THE DUST OF STRATFORD VILLAGE WE
KNOW BY OUR REASONING BOWERS THAT HERCULES HAS BEEN ALONG THERE I FEEL
THAT OUR FETISH IS SAFE FOR THREE CENTURIES YET THE BUST TOOTHERE IN
THE STRATFORD CHURCH THE PRECIOUS BUST THE PRICELESS BUST THE CALM
BUST THE SERENE BUST THE EMOTIONLESS BUST WITH THE DANDY MUSTACHE
AND THE PUTTY FACE UNSEAMED OF CARETHAT FACE WHICH HAS LOOKED
PASSIONLESSLY DOWN UPON THE AWED PILGRIM FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS
AND WILL STILL LOOK DOWN UPON THE AWED PILGRIM THREE HUNDRED MORE WITH
THE DEEP DEEP DEEP SUBTLE SUBTLE SUBTLE EXPRESSION OF A BLADDER

IRREVERENCE

ONE OF THE MOST TRYING DEFECTS WHICH I FIND IN THESETHESEWHAT SHALL I
CALL THEM FOR I WILL NOT APPLY INJURIOUS EPITHETS TO THEM THE WAY
THEY DO TO US SUCH VIOLATIONS OF COURTESY BEING REPUGNANT TO MY NATURE
AND MY DIGNITY THE FARTHEST I CAN GO IN THAT DIRECTION IS TO CALL THEM
BY NAMES OF LIMITED REVERENCENAMES MERELY DESCRIPTIVE NEVER UNKIND
NEVER OFFENSIVE NEVER TAINTED BY HARSH FEELING IF THEY WOULD DO
LIKE THIS THEY WOULD FEEL BETTER IN THEIR HEARTS VERY WELL THENTO
PROCEED ONE OF THE MOST TRYING DEFECTS WHICH I FIND IN THESE
STRATFORDOLATERS THESE SHAKESPERIODS THESE THUGS THESE BANGALORES
THESE TROGLODYTES THESE HERUMFRODITES THESE BLATHERSKITES THESE
BUCCANEERS THESE BANDOLEERS IS THEIR SPIRIT OF IRREVERENCE IT IS
DETECTABLE IN EVERY UTTERANCE OF THEIRS WHEN THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT US
I AM THANKFUL THAT IN ME THERE IS NOTHING OF THAT SPIRIT WHEN A THING
IS SACRED TO ME IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO BE IRREVERENT TOWARD IT I
CANNOT CALL TO MIND A SINGLE INSTANCE WHERE I HAVE EVER BEEN
IRREVERENT EXCEPT TOWARDS THE THINGS WHICH WERE SACRED TO OTHER
PEOPLE AM I IN THE RIGHT I THINK SO BUT I ASK NO ONE TO TAKE MY
UNSUPPORTED WORD NO LOOK AT THE DICTIONARY LET THE DICTIONARY
DECIDE HERE IS THE DEFINITION

IRREVERENCE THE QUALITY OR CONDITION OF IRREVERENCE TOWARD GOD AND
SACRED THINGS


WHAT DOES THE HINDU SAY HE SAYS IT IS CORRECT HE SAYS IRREVERENCE IS
LACK OF RESPECT FOR VISHNU AND BRAHMA AND CHRISHNA AND HIS OTHER
GODS AND FOR HIS SACRED CATTLE AND FOR HIS TEMPLES AND THE THINGS
WITHIN THEM HE ENDORSES THE DEFINITION YOU SEE AND THERE ARE
HINDUS OR THEIR EQUIVALENTS BACK OF HIM

THE DICTIONARY HAD THE ACUTE IDEA THAT BY USING THE CAPITAL G IT COULD
RESTRICT IRREVERENCE TO LACK OF REVERENCE FOR OUR DEITY AND OUR
SACRED THINGS BUT THAT INGENIOUS AND RATHER SLY IDEA MISCARRIED FOR
BY THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF SPELLING HIS DEITIES WITH CAPITALS THE HINDU
CONFISCATES THE DEFINITION AND RESTRICTS IT TO HIS OWN SECTS THUS
MAKING IT CLEARLY COMPULSORY UPON US TO REVERE HIS GODS AND HIS
SACRED THINGS AND NOBODYS ELSE WE CANT SAY A WORD FOR HE HAS OUR
OWN DICTIONARY AT HIS BACK AND ITS DECISION IS FINAL

THIS LAW REDUCED TO ITS SIMPLEST TERMS IS THIS WHATEVER IS SACRED
TO THE CHRISTIAN MUST BE HELD IN REVERENCE BY EVERYBODY ELSE
WHATEVER IS SACRED TO THE HINDU MUST BE HELD IN REVERENCE BY EVERYBODY
ELSE THEREFORE BY CONSEQUENCE LOGICALLY AND INDISPUTABLY
WHATEVER IS SACRED TO ME MUST BE HELD IN REVERENCE BY EVERYBODY ELSE

NOW THEN WHAT AGGRAVATES ME IS THAT THESE TROGLODYTES AND MUSCOVITES
AND BANDOLEERS AND BUCCANEERS ARE ALSO TRYING TO CROWD IN AND SHARE
THE BENEFIT OF THE LAW AND COMPEL EVERYBODY TO REVERE THEIR
SHAKESPEARE AND HOLD HIM SACRED WE CANT HAVE THAT THERES ENOUGH OF
US ALREADY IF YOU GO ON WIDENING AND SPREADING AND INFLATING THE
PRIVILEGE IT WILL PRESENTLY COME TO BE CONCEDED THAT EACH MANS SACRED
THINGS ARE THE ONLY ONES AND THE REST OF THE HUMAN RACE WILL HAVE TO
BE HUMBLY REVERENT TOWARD THEM OR SUFFER FOR IT THAT CAN SURELY
HAPPEN AND WHEN IT HAPPENS THE WORD IRREVERENCE WILL BE REGARDED AS
THE MOST MEANINGLESS AND FOOLISH AND SELFCONCEITED AND INSOLENT
AND IMPUDENT AND DICTATORIAL WORD IN THE LANGUAGE AND PEOPLE WILL
SAY WHOSE BUSINESS IS IT WHAT GODS I WORSHIP AND WHAT THINGS HOLD
SACRED WHO HAS THE RIGHT TO DICTATE TO MY CONSCIENCE AND WHERE DID HE
GET THAT RIGHT

WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LET THAT CALAMITY COME UPON US WE MUST SAVE THE
WORD FROM THIS DESTRUCTION THERE IS BUT ONE WAY TO DO IT AND THAT IS
TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE PRIVILEGE AND STRICTLY CONFINE IT TO ITS
PRESENT LIMITSTHAT IS TO ALL THE CHRISTIAN SECTS TO ALL THE HINDU
SECTS AND ME WE DO NOT NEED ANY MORE THE STOCK IS WATERED ENOUGH
JUST AS IT IS

IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THE PRIVILEGE WERE LIMITED TO ME ALONE I THINK
SO BECAUSE I AM THE ONLY SECT THAT KNOWS HOW TO EMPLOY IT GENTLY
KINDLY CHARITABLY DISPASSIONATELY THE OTHER SECTS LACK THE QUALITY
OF SELFRESTRAINT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SAYS THE MOST IRREVERENT THINGS
ABOUT MATTERS WHICH ARE SACRED TO THE PROTESTANTS AND THE PROTESTANT
CHURCH RETORTS IN KIND ABOUT THE CONFESSIONAL AND OTHER MATTERS WHICH
CATHOLICS HOLD SACRED THEN BOTH OF THESE IRREVERENCERS TURN UPON
THOMAS PAINE AND CHARGE HIM WITH IRREVERENCE THIS IS ALL
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR STUDENTS EQUIPPED WITH
ONLY A LOW GRADE OF MENTALITY TO FIND OUT WHAT IRREVERENCE REALLY IS

IT WILL SURELY BE MUCH BETTER ALL AROUND IF THE PRIVILEGE OF REGULATING
THE IRREVERENT AND KEEPING THEM IN ORDER SHALL EVENTUALLY BE WITHDRAWN
FROM ALL THE SECTS BUT ME THEN THERE WILL BE NO MORE QUARRELING NO
MORE BANDYING OF DISRESPECTFUL EPITHETS NO MORE HEARTBURNINGS

THERE WILL THEN BE NOTHING SACRED INVOLVED IN THIS BACONSHAKESPEARE
CONTROVERSY EXCEPT WHAT IS SACRED TO ME THAT WILL SIMPLIFY THE WHOLE
MATTER AND TROUBLE WILL CEASE THERE WILL BE IRREVERENCE NO LONGER
BECAUSE I WILL NOT ALLOW IT THE FIRST TIME THOSE CRIMINALS CHARGE ME
WITH IRREVERENCE FOR CALLING THEIR STRATFORD MYTH AN
ARTHURORTONMARYBAKERTHOMPSONEDDYLOUISTHESEVENTEENTHVEILED
PROPHET OFKHORASSAN WILL BE THE LAST TAUGHT BY THE METHODS FOUND
EFFECTIVE IN EXTINGUISHING EARLIER OFFENDERS BY THE INQUISITION OF
HOLY MEMORY I SHALL KNOW HOW TO QUIET THEM

YOU MAY ADD TO THE LIST THE THOUSAND CELEBRATED PERSONS FURNISHED BY
THE REST OF CHRISTENDOM IN THE PAST FOUR CENTURIES AND YOU CAN FIND
OUT THE LIFEHISTORIES OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE TOO YOU WILL THEN HAVE
LISTED FIFTEEN HUNDRED CELEBRITIES AND YOU CAN TRACE THE AUTHENTIC
LIFEHISTORIES OF THE WHOLE OF THEM SAVE ONEFAR AND AWAY THE MOST
COLOSSAL PRODIGY OF THE ENTIRE ACCUMULATIONSHAKESPEARE ABOUT HIM YOU
CAN FIND OUT NOTHING NOTHING OF EVEN THE SLIGHTEST IMPORTANCE
NOTHING WORTH THE TROUBLE OF STOWING AWAY IN YOUR MEMORY NOTHING THAT
EVEN REMOTELY INDICATES THAT HE WAS EVER ANYTHING MORE THAN A
DISTINCTLY COMMONPLACE PERSONA MANAGER AN ACTOR OF INFERIOR GRADE A
SMALL TRADER IN A SMALL VILLAGE THAT DID NOT REGARD HIM AS A PERSON OF
ANY CONSEQUENCE AND HAD FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT HIM BEFORE HE WAS FAIRLY
COLD IN HIS GRAVE WE CAN GO TO THE RECORDS AND FIND OUT THE
LIFEHISTORY OF EVERY RENOWNED RACEHORSE OF MODERN TIMESBUT NOT
SHAKESPEARES THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY AND THEY HAVE BEEN FURNISHED
IN CARTLOADS OF GUESS AND CONJECTURE BY THOSE TROGLODYTES BUT THERE
IS ONE THAT IS WORTH ALL THE REST OF THE REASONS PUT TOGETHER AND IS
ABUNDANTLY SUFFICIENT ALL BY ITSELFHE HADNT ANY HISTORY TO RECORD
THERE IS NO WAY OF GETTING AROUND THAT DEADLY FACT AND NO SANE WAY HAS
YET BEEN DISCOVERED OF GETTING AROUND ITS FORMIDABLE SIGNIFICANCE

ITS QUITE PLAIN SIGNIFICANCETO ANY BUT THOSE THUGS I DO NOT USE THE
TERM UNKINDLY IS THAT SHAKESPEARE HAD NO PROMINENCE WHILE HE LIVED
AND NONE UNTIL HE HAD BEEN DEAD TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS THE PLAYS
ENJOYED HIGH FAME FROM THE BEGINNING AND IF HE WROTE THEM IT SEEMS A
PITY THE WORLD DID NOT FIND IT OUT HE OUGHT TO HAVE EXPLAINED THAT HE
WAS THE AUTHOR AND NOT MERELY A NOM DE PLUME FOR ANOTHER MAN TO HIDE
BEHIND IF HE HAD BEEN LESS INTEMPERATELY SOLICITOUS ABOUT HIS BONES
AND MORE SOLICITOUS ABOUT HIS WORKS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER FOR HIS
GOOD NAME AND A KINDNESS TO US THE BONES WERE NOT IMPORTANT THEY
WILL MOULDER AWAY THEY WILL TURN TO DUST BUT THE WORKS WILL ENDURE
UNTIL THE LAST SUN GOES DOWN

MARK TWAIN


PS MARCH ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO I WAS ILLUMINATING THIS
AUTOBIOGRAPHY WITH SOME NOTIONS OF MINE CONCERNING THE
BACONSHAKESPEARE CONTROVERSY AND I THEN TOOK OCCASION TO AIR THE
OPINION THAT THE STRATFORD SHAKESPEARE WAS A PERSON OF NO PUBLIC
CONSEQUENCE OR CELEBRITY DURING HIS LIFETIME BUT WAS UTTERLY OBSCURE
AND UNIMPORTANT AND NOT ONLY IN GREAT LONDON BUT ALSO IN THE LITTLE
VILLAGE WHERE HE WAS BORN WHERE HE LIVED A QUARTER OF A CENTURY AND
WHERE HE DIED AND WAS BURIED I ARGUED THAT IF HE HAD BEEN A PERSON OF
ANY NOTE AT ALL AGED VILLAGERS WOULD HAVE HAD MUCH TO TELL ABOUT HIM
MANY AND MANY A YEAR AFTER HIS DEATH INSTEAD OF BEING UNABLE TO
FURNISH INQUIRERS A SINGLE FACT CONNECTED WITH HIM I BELIEVED AND I
STILL BELIEVE THAT IF HE HAD BEEN FAMOUS HIS NOTORIETY WOULD HAVE
LASTED AS LONG AS MINE HAS LASTED IN MY NATIVE VILLAGE OUT IN MISSOURI
IT IS A GOOD ARGUMENT A PRODIGIOUSLY STRONG ONE AND MOST FORMIDABLE
ONE FOR EVEN THE MOST GIFTED AND INGENIOUS AND PLAUSIBLE
STRATFORDOLATOR TO GET AROUND OR EXPLAIN AWAY TODAY A HANNIBAL
COURIERPOST OF RECENT DATE HAS REACHED ME WITH AN ARTICLE IN IT
WHICH REINFORCES MY CONTENTION THAT A REALLY CELEBRATED PERSON CANNOT
BE FORGOTTEN IN HIS VILLAGE IN THE SHORT SPACE OF SIXTY YEARS I WILL
MAKE AN EXTRACT FROM IT


HANNIBAL AS A CITY MAY HAVE MANY SINS TO ANSWER FOR BUT INGRATITUDE
IS NOT ONE OF THEM OR REVERENCE FOR THE GREAT MEN SHE HAS PRODUCED
AND AS THE YEARS GO BY HER GREATEST SON MARK TWAIN OR S L CLEMENS
AS A FEW OF THE UNLETTERED CALL HIM GROWS IN THE ESTIMATION AND REGARD
OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE TOWN HE MADE FAMOUS AND THE TOWN THAT MADE HIM
FAMOUS HIS NAME IS ASSOCIATED WITH EVERY OLD BUILDING THAT IS TORN
DOWN TO MAKE WAY FOR THE MODERN STRUCTURES DEMANDED BY A RAPIDLY
GROWING CITY AND WITH EVERY HILL OR CAVE OVER OR THROUGH WHICH HE
MIGHT BY ANY POSSIBILITY HAVE ROAMED WHILE THE MANY POINTS OF INTEREST
WHICH HE WOVE INTO HIS STORIES SUCH AS HOLIDAY HILL JACKSONS ISLAND
OR MARK TWAIN CAVE ARE NOW MONUMENTS TO HIS GENIUS HANNIBAL IS GLAD
OF ANY OPPORTUNITY TO DO HIM HONOR AS HE HAD HONORED HER

SO IT HAS HAPPENED THAT THE OLD TIMERS WHO WENT TO SCHOOL WITH MARK
OR WERE WITH HIM ON SOME OF HIS USUAL ESCAPADES HAVE BEEN HONORED WITH
LARGE AUDIENCES WHENEVER THEY WERE IN A REMINISCENT MOOD AND
CONDESCENDED TO TELL OF THEIR INTIMACY WITH THE ORDINARY BOY WHO CAME
TO BE A VERY EXTRAORDINARY HUMORIST AND WHOSE EVERY BOYISH ACT IS NOW
SEEN TO HAVE BEEN INDICATIVE OF WHAT WAS TO COME LIKE AUNT BECKY AND
MRS CLEMENS THEY CAN NOW SEE THAT MARK WAS HARDLY APPRECIATED WHEN HE
LIVED HERE AND THAT THE THINGS HE DID AS A BOY AND WAS WHIPPED FOR
DOING WERE NOT ALL BAD AFTER ALL SO THEY HAVE BEEN IN NO HESITANCY
ABOUT DRAWING OUT THE BAD THINGS HE DID AS WELL AS THE GOOD IN THEIR
EFFORTS TO GET A MARK TWAIN STORY ALL INCIDENTS BEING VIEWED IN THE
LIGHT OF HIS PRESENT FAME UNTIL THE VOLUME OF TWAINIANA IS ALREADY
CONSIDERABLE AND GROWING IN PROPORTION AS THE OLD TIMERS DROP AWAY
AND THE STORIES ARE RETOLD SECOND AND THIRD HAND BY THEIR DESCENDANTS
WITH SOME SEVENTYTHREE YEARS YOUNG AND LIVING IN A VILLA INSTEAD OF A
HOUSE HE IS A FAIR TARGET AND LET HIM INCORPORATE COPYRIGHT OR
PATENT HIMSELF AS HE WILL THERE ARE SOME OF HIS WORKS THAT WILL GO
SWOOPING UP HANNIBAL CHIMNEYS AS LONG AS GRAYBEARDS GATHER ABOUT THE
FIRES AND BEGIN WITH IVE HEARD FATHER TELL OR POSSIBLY ONCE WHEN
I THE MRS CLEMENS REFERRED TO IS MY MOTHERWAS MY MOTHER


AND HERE IS ANOTHER EXTRACT FROM A HANNIBAL PAPER OF DATE TWENTY DAYS
AGO

MISS BECCA BLANKENSHIP DIED AT THE HOME OF WILLIAM DICKASON ROCK
STREET AT OCLOCK YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AGED YEARS THE
DECEASED WAS A SISTER OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN ONE OF THE FAMOUS
CHARACTERS IN MARK TWAINS TOM SAWYER SHE HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF THE
DICKASON FAMILYTHE HOUSEKEEPER FOR NEARLY FORTYFIVE YEARS AND WAS A
HIGHLY RESPECTED LADY FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS SHE HAD BEEN AN
INVALID BUT WAS AS WELL CARED FOR BY MR DICKASON AND HIS FAMILY AS IF
SHE HAD BEEN A NEAR RELATIVE SHE WAS A MEMBER OF THE PARK METHODIST
CHURCH AND A CHRISTIAN WOMAN


I REMEMBER HER WELL I HAVE A PICTURE OF HER IN MY MIND WHICH WAS
GRAVEN THERE CLEAR AND SHARP AND VIVID SIXTYTHREE YEARS AGO SHE WAS
AT THAT TIME NINE YEARS OLD AND I WAS ABOUT ELEVEN I REMEMBER WHERE
SHE STOOD AND HOW SHE LOOKED AND I CAN STILL SEE HER BARE FEET HER
BARE HEAD HER BROWN FACE AND HER SHORT TOWLINEN FROCK SHE WAS
CRYING WHAT IT WAS ABOUT I HAVE LONG AGO FORGOTTEN BUT IT WAS THE
TEARS THAT PRESERVED THE PICTURE FOR ME NO DOUBT SHE WAS A GOOD
CHILD I CAN SAY THAT FOR HER SHE KNEW ME NEARLY SEVENTY YEARS AGO
DID SHE FORGET ME IN THE COURSE OF TIME I THINK NOT IF SHE HAD LIVED
IN STRATFORD IN SHAKESPEARES TIME WOULD SHE HAVE FORGOTTEN HIM YES
FOR HE WAS NEVER FAMOUS DURING HIS LIFETIME HE WAS UTTERLY OBSCURE IN
STRATFORD AND THERE WOULDNT BE ANY OCCASION TO REMEMBER HIM AFTER HE
HAD BEEN DEAD A WEEK

INJUN JOE JIMMY FINN AND GENERAL GAINES WERE PROMINENT AND VERY
INTEMPERATE NEERDOWEELS IN HANNIBAL TWO GENERATIONS AGO PLENTY OF
GRAYHEADS THERE REMEMBER THEM TO THIS DAY AND CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THEM
ISNT IT CURIOUS THAT TWO TOWN DRUNKARDS AND ONE HALFBREED LOAFER
SHOULD LEAVE BEHIND THEM IN A REMOTE MISSOURIAN VILLAGE A FAME A
HUNDRED TIMES GREATER AND SEVERAL HUNDRED TIMES MORE PARTICULARIZED IN
THE MATTER OF DEFINITE FACTS THAN SHAKESPEARE LEFT BEHIND HIM IN THE
VILLAGE WHERE HE HAD LIVED THE HALF OF HIS LIFETIME
